Bob Corker said on Sunday that President Donald Trump pushed the government into partial shutdown as an act of political posturing.\n\n\"This is a made-up fight, so the President can look like he's fighting, but even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure,\" Corker said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nCorker's comments came as the partial government shutdown went into its second day, following Congress and Trump failing to come to a funding agreement on Friday. The Senate adjourned on Saturday without an agreement, meaning the shutdown would likely continue past Christmas.\n\nCorker, a retiring senator and frequent Trump critic, said the dispute over border security and Trump's proposed border wall was \"a purposefully contrived fight\" and argued the fight was small in scope compared to a proposed deal earlier this year ahead of a January government shutdown that would have combined greater money at the border along with protection for \"Dreamers.\"\n\n\"We can secure our borders,\" Corker said. \"We can solve this problem. This is a made-up fight.\"\n\nAsked if he meant Trump was using this as a campaign issue rather than seeking a deal, Corker said, \"it has to be that.\"\n\n\"It's a spectacle, and candidly, it's juvenile,\" Corker said. \"The whole thing is juvenile.\"\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Trump personally responded to Corker's CNN appearance and took issue with Corker's criticism of his decisions to withdraw troops from Syria and plan for a drawdown in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Senator Bob Corker just stated that, 'I'm so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and that's what I told the people of our state that's what I'd do, serve for two terms.' But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn't endorse him.....\" Trump tweeted.\n\nLater, he continued, \".....Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!\"\n\nTrump's tweets largely mirrored an attack against Corker from late 2017, shortly after Corker announced he would not seek re-election. At the time, Corker's chief of staff Todd Womack said Trump had called Corker asking the Tennessee senator to reconsider retiring and \"reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him.\"\n\nWomack on Sunday stood by his statement from October 2017.\n\nTwo sources told CNN at the time that Trump told Corker he would endorse him the day he announced he would retire. Likewise, as CNN has previously noted , Corker was opposed to the Iran Deal.\n\nIn their October 2017 spat, Corker referred to the White House as an \"adult day care center,\" and on Sunday, he resurfaced the line.\n\n\"Yes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff,\" Corker tweeted in response to Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "What to expect as the partial government shutdown continues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/QY1Np5Gards/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A partial government shutdown remains in effect after funding expired for roughly a quarter of the federal government when the clock struck midnight on Saturday -- and it is not clear when it will end.\n\nNegotiations between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over the President's demands for a border wall have so far not yielded an agreement, making it likely that the shutdown will continue until after Christmas. It is even possible that it could still be underway when the new Congress starts in early January.\n\nHere's a look at the latest on negotiations and the outlook for the partial shutdown:\n\nHow long is the shutdown expected to last?\n\nThe President's incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that \"it is very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress\" during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nA spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told CNN Sunday that \"if Director Mulvaney says the Trump Shutdown will last into the New Year, believe him \u2014 because it's their shutdown.\"\n\nSchumer made a counteroffer on border security, according to a Democratic source familiar with the negotiations -- before Saturday when he met with Vice President Mike Pence -- to Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby and that was rejected by the White House. Pence then made his own offer on Saturday, which was rejected by Schumer.\n\nSchumer and Shelby have been having side discussions, but they don't appear to have yielded much progress given the differences between Schumer and the White House, the source added.\n\nThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no deal to re-open the government, and while there will be a pro forma Senate session on Monday, the next actual session is not scheduled until Thursday.\n\nLawmakers can travel home for Christmas and won't have to worry about being called back to vote until a deal can be reached, but GOP leaders told senators that if there is no deal by Thursday, they would not have to return for that session, sources have told CNN.\n\nWhat are the next possible steps?\n\nThere is a remote possibility that a deal could come together sooner, and in the unlikely event a deal is reached by Monday, the pro forma session could be used to pass it by unanimous consent or voice vote, something that would only require one senator to be in attendance.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have said that the new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will pass a bill to stop the shutdown if it lasts into the new Congress.\n\n\"If President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January,\" the Democratic leaders said in a joint statement after the shutdown started.\n\nWhere do negotiations stand between the President and Democrats?\n\nThe key sticking point in the spending standoff is President Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion for a border wall. And so far, there is still no agreement to resolve the standoff and re-open the government.\n\nHouse Republicans passed a spending bill that included an additional $5 billion for the wall last week, but the legislation is considered dead on arrival in the Senate where Democrats have said they would not support it. Any spending bill needs at least some Democratic votes to pass in the Senate.\n\nVice President Mike Pence proposed spending $2.5 billion on border security, including the wall, in a stopgap spending bill during meetings on Friday night and Saturday afternoon with Schumer, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSeveral of the sources said there were policy additions and restrictions included in the proposal to try to bridge the gap. But Democrats said the number and the details tied to it aren't acceptable.\n\nFollowing the Saturday meeting, a Schumer spokesman said, \"The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we're still very far apart.\"\n\nWhich parts of the government are affected?\n\nKey parts of the federal government have been impacted by the shutdown, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the Interior Department, the State Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut just because a federal department is subject to a lapse in funding, that doesn't mean that all of its activities immediately stop.\n\nTypically in the event of a shutdown, some federal employees deemed essential continue to work, but their pay is withheld until the shutdown is over, while other federal employees are placed on furlough, meaning they are effectively put on a leave of absence without pay. Congress can move to order that furloughed employees be paid retroactively after a shutdown is over, though that is not guaranteed.\n\nSome affected departments have put out information to explain how the shutdown will play out.\n\nThe Agriculture Department said on Twitter that \"we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources.\" A press release issued by the department specified that some of the activities that will not stop at least in the short-term include Forest Service law enforcement and emergency and natural disaster response.\n\nAn administration official told CNN prior to the shutdown began that \"a majority of DHS activities would continue\" if there were a lapse in appropriations.\n\n\"For instance, those protecting our borders with the Customs and Border Patrol will continue to do so,\" the official said.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the Justice Department will be impacted, special counsel Robert Mueller's office will be able to continue working.\n\nMueller's office \"is funded from a permanent indefinite appropriation and would be unaffected in the event of a shutdown,\" a Justice Department spokesperson told CNN previously.\n\nWill the shutdown impact holiday travel?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration will be on the job to screen passengers, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers will be directing planes.\n\nThe FAA released a statement saying that \"air traffic control is fully operational and there is no impact to safety or FAA oversight for travelers.\"\n\nAmtrak, a federally owned corporation rather than a government agency, will be open. Federal Railroad Administration inspectors will also continue to work.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection checkpoints will remain open for international travelers, and the State Department will also continue processing passports.\n\nHow many federal workers will be impacted?\n\nAn estimated 800,000 federal employees may be impacted by the partial shutdown, either by having to work during it while their pay is withheld until it ends or by being furloughed.\n\nMore than 420,000 government workers are expected to work without pay in a partial shutdown, according to a fact sheet released by the Democratic staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThat estimate includes more than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers. In addition, more than 380,000 federal employees would be placed on furlough, according to the fact sheet.\n\nBefore adjourning on Friday, the Senate passed a bill to ensure federal employees who are furloughed get back pay. It was passed by unanimous consent, but still will need to pass the House. The measure was brought up by Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, who represent Maryland, where many DC-area federal employees live."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: Why Trump can't let go of his border wall dream", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GvKAYs0kTSw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) President Trump has shut down the government over his failure to obtain funding for a wall across America's border with Mexico. He says it's about \"border security,\" but the reality is far more disturbing.\n\nTrump's wall is \"deeply rooted in xenophobia,\" Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, explained Thursday on my SiriusXM radio show. Omar, who will make history as both the first Somali refugee and the first Muslim-American female to wear a hijab in Congress, added, \"there are folks on the right, political pundits on TV shows talking about how immigrants make this country dirty and poor and more dangerous.\" (She was referring to recent inflammatory comments about immigrants by Fox News' Tucker Carlson.)\n\nOmar is correct. Trump's wall is about an irrational fear of outsiders -- but it's about more than that, too. Trump's wall is designed to address a key concern of his base: the browning of America. Bluntly, Trump's wall, if built, will likely be the largest and most expensive monument ever constructed to try and ensure the demographic supremacy of white America.\n\nTrue, a massive wall that climbs 32 feet in the air, as Trump has discussed, and spans thousands of miles could provide some degree of border security. But then again, so would stationing US troops -- in locked arms -- across the border, or building a massive \"Game of Thrones\"-type ice wall. The question is what is the most effective in achieving that goal -- especially since Trump wants us to pay for it after he failed to get Mexico to bear the cost, as he had previously promised.\n\nThis past week, Republican Rep. Will Hurd from Texas, a former CIA agent, slammed the \"fallacy that a wall equals border security.\" He explained, \"I have more border (in my district) than any other member of Congress, 820 miles,\" and added that we can use available technology to keep us far safer than a wall. Hurd closed with a key point: \"Building a wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security.\"\n\nBut Trump refuses to accept that technology suggested by people like Hurd and others will address the problem. Instead, Trump on Sunday took to Twitter to mock that very concept, writing, \"Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun,\" he wrote, but the \"only way to stop drug, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements\" is by building a \"good old fashioned Wall\" -- or, perhaps, a \"Steel Slat Barrier.\"\n\nHmm, whom to believe? A serial liar like Trump, or a former CIA operative who now represents a district along the Texas border?\n\nFor me, the choice is clear -- not only given Trump's track record, but because statistics also undermine his claims. First, despite what Trump wants you to believe, studies make it clear that immigrants, both undocumented and those legally here, are \"considerably less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens.\" One study, conducted by the Cato Institute, found that \"as a percentage of their respective populations, there were 56% fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015.\"\n\nOn top of that, illegal border crossings are currently at their lowest levels since 2000. And nearly two thirds of those now in the country illegally are here because they overstayed their visas after arriving via airports, while others even came over the northern border from Canada. A massive southern border wall obviously won't address this.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer to Trump: Abandon the wall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer to Trump: Abandon the wall 02:21\n\nThese facts are likely why polls consistently find a solid majority of Americans oppose building a wall, including 66% of independent voters , according to a recent CBS News poll. Even Texans oppose the wall. In a Quinnipiac poll, 61% were against it, while only 34% favored it.\n\nBut not Trump's base. A November poll found that nearly 80% of Republicans want the wall built.\n\nWhy this overwhelming support? It boils down to what actually motivates the base. Studies after the election found that many Trump supporters did not have \"economic anxiety,\" as some in media had previously reported. Rather, they were concerned with a \"loss of status,\" or more accurately , \"white anxiety\" over changing demographics. As one study at the University of Pennsylvania noted, Trump voters feared \"a threat to their group's dominance in our country over all.\"\n\nTrump's wall is a perfect symbolic panacea for those people fearful of demographic change. Sure, it may not actually work as hoped, but it will likely give them some comfort.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIt's also likely Trump shares their concerns, given his reported comments that he doesn't want immigrants from Africa and Haiti, which he deemed \"shithole\" countries, and prefers people from Norway, a predominately white nation. With comments like those, it's no wonder that some white supremacists support this President.\n\nBorder security is a bipartisan issue -- Democrats and Republican both want it. So, if Trump truly wants to keep America safe, he would use technology that is both effective and cost efficient. But if his real fear is changing demographics and he wants to give phony reassurance to his base voters, then the only option is a \"good old-fashioned Wall.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Bob Corker fires back at Trump on Twitter", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vI6eteNxSp8/bob-corker-tweet-daycare-staff-trump-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

As of Sunday morning, Brian Kolfage had raised about $16 million for a wall on the US border with Mexico.\n\nTrump said Wednesday, amid debate over a potential government shutdown, that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall via a trade deal and that the US military would build it.\n\n\"Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,\" Kolfage writes on his verified GoFundMe, which had more than 218,000 donors as of Friday evening.\n\nMexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!\n\nKolfage had the idea about a year ago but decided to move forward Sunday because of \"inaction from our politicians,\" he told CNN via email. He is surprised by the amount of money he's been able to raise, he wrote.\n\n\"I've been receiving thousands of emails from citizens who have waited in line to become Americans and completed this process the legal way. They are so thankful for this,\" he wrote. \"They are giving and they are from both sides of the aisle, and that's why this movement is growing so fast.\"\n\nWhile the campaign has a goal of $1 billion, the Destin, Florida, man who lost both legs and his right hand in Iraq says $1 billion is GoFundMe's max and he's working to have it increased. The most successful GoFundMe effort to date has raised more than $22 million and counting in the last year for the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which provides counsel to victims of sexual abuse and harassment.\n\nA call to stop 'illegals'\n\nThe grandson of immigrants who arrived in the United States \"legally,\" he says, Kolfage is working with the White House to establish a point of contact for the money. US Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Mississippi, plans to introduce a bill directing the Treasury Department to issue bonds to fund the wall, though there are other options \"on the table,\" Kolfage says on the GoFundMe page.\n\n\"We haven't spoken directly to the President but would like to,\" he told CNN via email. \"After all, this is for his campaign promise. The people are yelling, and I hope he listens.\"\n\nThe veteran is working with a law firm to craft a binding document to ensure all money goes to the wall, and if the goal isn't reached, all donations will be refunded, he said.\n\nBrian Kolfage meets with American airmen at a military base in Germany in 2012.\n\nSaying Trump has \"followed through on just about every promise\" he made in his campaign, Kolfage says it's every citizen's duty to help Trump overcome Democratic resistance to the wall and \"make America safe again.\"\n\n\"Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society,\" the husband and father says in soliciting donations.\n\nWhile it's unusual for Americans to kick in money above what they pay in taxes for government functions, it is not unheard of. Financier David Rubenstein has donated tens of millions to restore the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Arlington House and US Marine Corps War Memorial as well as give the National Zoo $9 million for its panda conservation efforts.\n\nLife after horrific mortar wounds\n\nBilling himself as the \"most wounded US airman to survive his wounds,\" Kolfage says on his personal website that as a speaker, he can motivate groups and \"inspire them to be better people in their daily life.\"\n\nIn a 2012 CNN profile , the Detroit native said he started his Air Force career in the security forces and traveled to Iraq and Kuwait after 9/11.

The recruit bailed, allowing Kolfage to make the trip, he said.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, after a night of customs enforcement work, Kolfage awoke in the afternoon. Shortly after leaving his tent, he heard a blast that rendered him unconscious. When he came to, he learned a mortar had landed feet away from him, horrifically wounding him.\n\nHis friends would later tell him that while moving him to a stretcher, they had to hold his body parts in place for fear they'd fall off. In the on-base trauma center, the doctors tending to him \"looked like they were scared s***less,\" he told CNN.\n\nHe woke up two weeks later in Ward 57 of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

The 47-year-old walked out the door of his basement apartment a month ago and never came back.\n\nThe story of Samuel Oliver-Bruno and the church that tried to protect him made national news.\n\nVideos of his arrest at an immigration office went viral. So did the images of religious leaders, church members and supporters locking arms as they surrounded an ICE van in a standoff that lasted hours.\n\nBut there was another circle of people you didn't see that day.\n\nThey were inside other churches just miles away, glued to their phones and laptops, filled with a growing sense of dread.\n\nThey panicked as they watched live video of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents handcuffing their friend and taking him into custody.\n\nThey grieved when they learned he'd been deported to Mexico less than a week later.\n\nAnd they faced a harrowing question that's still haunting them as they prepare to spend another Christmas inside churches they're afraid to leave:\n\nWill I be next?\n\n\"We are in the same situation,\" says Juana Tobar Ortega, who's been living in a North Carolina church for nearly 19 months. \"And we see that things are getting worse.\"\n\nA community shaken\n\nOne by one, the announcements of immigrants taking shelter in churches fell like dominoes across the country after President Trump took office.\n\nHis administration's crackdowns triggered a new chapter in a movement that began in the 1980s with congregations across the US sheltering Central American immigrants facing deportation.\n\nThey are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to Nearly two years into Trump's presidency, about 50 people are living in sanctuary inside churches nationwide, according to Church World Service.They are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to its policy of not arresting anyone in \"sensitive locations\" -- schools, hospitals or houses of worship -- except in extenuating circumstances\n\nSamuel Oliver-Bruno's shoes are still inside the room where he lived at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham. ICE agents arrested him when he went to an appointment at an immigration office, then deported him to Mexico.\n\nWhile only a sliver of churches have joined the sanctuary movement, advocates say it's growing -- and North Carolina has been fertile ground.\n\nChurches in some of the state's more liberal-leaning cities led the way. Two churches in Greensboro first opened their doors. Then congregations in the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill followed suit.\n\nFor much of this year, according to one nonprofit , North Carolina was the state with the largest number of churches hosting immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nCityWell United Methodist Church in Durham was among them. That's where Samuel Oliver-Bruno took sanctuary. His sudden arrest at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office, where he'd been asked to give fingerprints as part of his application for deferred action, left a shaken community searching for answers.\n\nICE says agents arrested Samuel as part of a \"targeted enforcement action.\" He'd used a fraudulent Texas birth certificate when he entered the United States in 2014. And his case had been subject to extensive appeals since then, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said.\n\nICE has maintained that Samuel's detention and deportation were \"in full accordance with federal law and agency policy.\" Any foreign national who's in the United States illegally is subject to arrest and removal, the agency says, no matter how long they've been living in a so-called sensitive location.\n\n\"Mr. Oliver-Bruno is a convicted criminal who has received all appropriate legal process under federal law, has no outstanding appeals and has no legal basis to remain in the US,\" Cox said.\n\nBut Samuel's supporters describe him as a devoted father and husband who'd lived in North Carolina with his family for much of the last two decades. He'd been seeking a humanitarian waiver to stay in the United States to support his wife, who suffers from lupus and other serious illnesses.\n\nAuthorities deported him this month.\n\nAnd it's not just immigrants in sanctuary who are reeling as a result. So are the churches that took them in.\n\nA seamstress mourns for her friend -- and an uncertain future\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega smiles as soon as she hears the knock on the door.\n\nShe's been preparing for this moment for hours. It will be a welcome respite after weeks of grief. Ever since Samuel's arrest, she's struggled to stop crying.\n\nIt's time for the posada, a traditional Latin American singing ritual re-enacting Joseph and Mary's search for shelter the night Jesus was born -- with half the group playing the role of the innkeeper, and the other half playing the role of pilgrims looking for a place to stay.\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega and several family members look on as the Rev. Audra Abt preaches at a holiday service. \"I want to thank you, Juana, for your faith and for your strength on this very difficult journey,\" the pastor said.\n\nJuana and her family are the innkeepers this year. They open the door, and at first sing lyrics spurning the uninvited guests.\n\n\"This is not an inn. I don't take in strangers. You might be a robber. I can't risk that danger.\"\n\nThe symbolism isn't lost on Juana or members of the church where she's been living for nearly 19 months. Juana was the first immigrant to seek sanctuary in a North Carolina church after Trump's election. She began living at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro on May 31, 2017 , decades after she first came to the United States from Guatemala seeking asylum.\n\nJuana lost her asylum case, but she'd been checking in regularly with ICE since 2011. Each year, officials renewed a stay on her removal order, allowing her to remain in the country. That changed after Trump took office. When she went to her check-in that year, officials outfitted her with an ankle monitor and said she had just a few weeks to leave the country.\n\nJuana decided seeking sanctuary was her only option. Saint Barnabas opened its doors and welcomed her.\n\nJust like Juana does at the end of today's song:\n\n\"Enter, enter, holy pilgrims, holy pilgrims. Welcome to my humble home. Though it's little I can offer, I can offer, all I have, please call your own.\"\n\nChristine Merriman loved seeing Juana at the door, letting visitors in.\n\nA church member who's spent hours by Juana's side as part of a rotation of volunteers who stay with her, Merriman says only one thing was missing.\n\n\"We should have built a border wall out of cardboard blocks,\" she says, \"then knocked it down.\"\n\nJuana laughs.\n\n\"Maybe next year we can,\" she says.\n\nThen she pauses.\n\nThis is her second Christmas in sanctuary. She hopes she won't be here for a third.\n\nBut she's afraid she will.\n\nShe never thought she'd be here this long. The 46-year-old seamstress lives in a narrow room with concrete walls covered with artwork her grandchildren covered in words of encouragement:\n\n\"USA is a free country.\"\n\n\"We know your not leaving.\"\n\n\"If unicorns love each other, we all love each other.\"\n\nAmid festive preparations for a celebration just days before Christmas, Samuel's recent deportation comes up and the mood turns somber. \"We didn't expect such bad news,\" Juana says as her granddaughter Koral Bridguett leans in to comfort her.\n\nSewing and art projects help Juana pass the time. Her four children, two grandchildren and other family members often visit on weekends. But when they're gone, depression sinks in.\n\nAnd in the last few weeks, she says, grief has overwhelmed her.\n\nShe spoke with Samuel on a weekly conference call for people in sanctuary. She'd heard how excited he was about moving forward with his case. He told the group he was doing it for all of them, not just for himself.\n\nHis arrest was a chilling reminder of a reality she'd hoped was changing.\n\n\"There is no mercy at all for us,\" she says.\n\nFor Juana, seeing how many people supported Samuel was the only blessing. It helped her remember she's not alone.\n\nA pastor waits in sanctuary, praying for a way out\n\nJos\u00e9 Chicas flips open his laptop, logs into Facebook and gets ready to hit record.\n\nIt's almost 4 a.m. -- time for the daily prayer he broadcasts to the world.\n\nBehind him, newspaper articles on the wall tell the story of a preacher who's been separated from his flock.\n\n\"Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandonado en santuario,\" one headline reads. Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandoned in sanctuary.\n\nBuoyed by support from the Rev. William Barber, Jos\u00e9 Chicas took sanctuary in the School for Conversion, on the grounds of a Durham Baptist church, in June 2017.\n\n\"That church can be your sanctuary until it is worked out in the courts,\" Barber told a rally last year . \"Let them come into the house of God and try to seize a child of God!\"\n\nIn a strip mall storefront some 30 minutes away, Jos\u00e9's wife is trying to keep their evangelical church afloat on top of her job on the cleaning crew at a local university. But the congregation's ranks have thinned. Some didn't like the idea of a woman preaching. Others felt Jos\u00e9's case was taking too long.\n\nSo now, Pastor Jos\u00e9 prays online in live videos shared with anyone who will listen.\n\nHe sways in his seat and taps his foot on the floor as he asks God for help -- for marriages that are suffering, for people who haven't found Jesus yet, for those who have strayed.\n\nJos\u00e9 believes in redemption. Using drugs and alcohol put him on a dangerous path, he says -- one that led to a conviction for DUI and domestic abuse. But those days, he says, are long ago. He draws on them to shape his sermons but says he's a changed man.\n\n\"I was lost. I will never forget that day, February 28, 2002. I changed my life,\" he says in this morning's prayer.\n\nHis voice crescendos with each sentence. This is a story he never tires of telling.\n\n\"I never touched a beer or a cigarette again,\" he says, \"because Christ changes man.\"\n\nHe misses preaching from the pulpit. Tomorrow dozens of people from his Raleigh congregation will visit for a Christmas dinner. He's been counting the days. He has gifts for all of them wrapped in his room.\n\nThis morning, the screen says only one person is watching. But Jos\u00e9 knows with each passing minute, his online flock will grow.\n\nHe prays for his 11-year-old son, who's been suffering from a stomachache and struggling in school. He prays for members of his church and for people who've posted on his Facebook wall asking for help. He prays for migrant caravans, for the Venezuelan people, for people facing violence in his native El Salvador. He prays for his neighbors and the city that's supporting him.\n\nBut those aren't the only people on his mind.\n\nAn evangelical pastor, Jos\u00e9 begins every day with a 4 a.m. prayer that he broadcasts live on Facebook.\n\nHe also prays for Samuel, whose photo still hangs on the wall in the next room, beside pictures of other immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nActivists once had dubbed them the \" NC Sanctuary 6 .\" They became the \"NC Sanctuary 5\" after a court let one of them leave the church where he'd been living.\n\nAnd now there are four.\n\nJos\u00e9 applied for the same humanitarian protection as Samuel. He doesn't know why Samuel was the first to get a letter from immigration officials, asking him to come in for an appointment. Jos\u00e9 knows he could have been the one who ended up in the back of an ICE van the day after Thanksgiving. Watching video of the arrest made his heart sink.\n\n\"Make a miracle, Lord, for my brother Samuel ... have mercy. He was just deported to Mexico, blessed father.\"\n\nThe prayer doesn't end there. Jos\u00e9 also prays for the officials who deported Samuel. He knows firsthand how God's power can transform people.\n\n\"Lord, hallelujah, have mercy, touch these immigration officers. ... Touch them. Change them,\" he says. \"Blessed God, we are not criminals, father.\"\n\nHe pauses to wipe away tears welling up in his eyes, then keeps praying.\n\nSanctuary's somber side\n\nFor immigrants living in churches, the public side to sanctuary is only part of the picture.\n\nYes, beautiful friendships are formed between people who never realized how much they had in common. And new groups of advocates step up to take a stand.\n\nBut after the fanfare of the first few days, the press conference, the push for community support, there is another side to sanctuary-- a painful reality made even more acute by Samuel's arrest.\n\nOn a bulletin board at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro, church members and Juana's family have posted reasons why they're grateful.\n\nThe Monday mornings alone when loved ones have left and pews are empty.\n\nThe sleepless nights and the crushing desire to stay in bed.\n\nThe lack of privacy and the fear of being alone.\n\nThe buoyancy of feeling embraced by strangers and the devastation of feeling abandoned by friends.\n\nThe constant search for a way out. The fear it may never come.\n\nFacing questions he doesn't know how to answer\n\nWith his children by his side, Eliseo Jimenez joins his church in prayer.\n\n\"Every month we need healing,\" the congregation says in unison, \"but December can be the hardest time of year.\"\n\nThis will be Eliseo's second Christmas in sanctuary.\n\nHe's been living here almost 15 months.\n\nBeing separated from his children each week is devastating. There's a white board on the wall of his bedroom where his kids -- 6-year-old Allison and 5-year-old Christopher -- like to doodle when they come to visit.\n\n\"I love you dad,\" Allison wrote.\n\n\"Me too,\" Eliseo replied.\n\nEliseo Jimenez and his 5-year-old son Christopher watch a worship service at Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh. Jimenez, 40, has been living in the church since October 2017.\n\nBut being with his kids is hard, too. Allison asks questions he's not sure how to answer. Why can't he go to the park to play with them? Why doesn't he go home with them on Sunday nights? Eliseo tries to change the subject. He doesn't want to ruin their childhood.\n\nWhen they visit, they spend most of their time playing inside. Eliseo's skittish being outdoors, even in the church parking lot.\n\n\"I have to be on the lookout for any strange car or any person,\" he says. \"It's always the fear to go outside and be distracted playing with the kids, and there might be somebody.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico has lived most of his life in the United States. He was deported once in 2007. And since October 2017, he's been living here, in Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh, to try to keep that from happening again.\n\nSamuel's picture is on a bulletin board near the room where Eliseo sleeps. About a year ago, Samuel visited Eliseo, asking for advice before going into sanctuary.\n\nFind something to do around your church, Eliseo told him, \"fixing, cleaning or helping anybody possible with anything.\"\n\nThat, Eliseo says, is what's kept him sane.\n\nToday, as he sits in the church's second row, Eliseo looks with pride at something he built that's on display behind the pulpit -- a miniature replica of the stable where Jesus was born.\n\nThe children's director mentions it as she calls kids to the front of the room for their portion of the Sunday service.\n\n\"During this season we like to talk about hope and peace,\" Peg Arcari says. \"We can talk about spreading joy. If somebody says they need help, we should share and be kind to one another.\"\n\nAs the children circle around her, Arcari points to Eliseo's work.\n\n\"By creating this stable,\" she says, \"Allison and Christopher's dad spread some joy.\"\n\nEliseo tries to keep things as normal as possible for his kids when they come to visit. But they've started to ask questions he doesn't know how to answer, like why he can't play in the park or go with them out to dinner.\n\nBeing stuck in here over the holidays is difficult. But Eliseo says he's lived through worse.\n\nSeveral years ago, he spent Christmas inside the Stewart Detention Center in South Georgia, the largest immigrant detention center in the Southeast . Authorities threatened to deport him that week. They put him on a bus and said they were sending him back to Mexico.\n\nThe only way he could convince someone to listen to him was by smashing his head so hard into a seat that he started bleeding. Then they double checked his files and discovered that an attorney had submitted a new petition for him to stay in the country.\n\nEliseo was released from custody that day. He says an official told him as long as he stayed out of trouble and kept checking in with ICE, he'd be in the clear. But Eliseo says that changed for him and so many others after Trump took office. They suddenly found their work permits weren't being renewed and long-delayed deportation orders were taking effect.\n\nSince the day he left Stewart, he hasn't been able to shake the feeling of constant fear. No matter what happens with his case, he doesn't think he ever will.\n\nHaunting nightmares\n\nThe glow of holiday lights reflects on Rosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz's face as she sits beside a small Christmas tree.\n\nIn a matter of days, her children will be visiting, but she doesn't feel much like celebrating.\n\nShe feels trapped inside the room where she's living. Last night she couldn't sleep. She's been crying all morning.\n\nSince she entered sanctuary at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill in April, Rosa has regularly spoken with her children on the phone. Their photos hang on the wall in the converted office that's become her bedroom. \"I love my babies,\" one picture says. But visits can be heartbreaking. It crushes her every time her children walk out the door.\n\nAn immigration court in Charlotte has ordered her deportation. But Rosa is appealing. She never expected the wait for an answer would take so long.\n\nShe jumps every time her phone rings, hoping her attorney is calling with news.\n\nAnd since Samuel's arrest, she's felt even more on edge. She's afraid to talk on the phone about her case -- and afraid of what will happen next.\n\n\"There's a heightened level of fear,\" says the Rev. Isaac Villegas of Chapel Hill Mennonite Fellowship, which rents space at Church of Reconciliation and is co-hosting Rosa in sanctuary. \"We have someone at the church 24 hours a day just to make Rosa feel safer and to keep her safe.\"\n\nRosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz chats with volunteer Libby Johnson as she makes pupusas at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill. The two women have become close friends since Rosa began living at the church in April.\n\nRosa is terrified to return to Honduras, a country she fled after her partner stabbed her. She says he's threatened to kill her if she ever returns.\n\nWhen she does manage to sleep, a recurring nightmare haunts her. Night after night, she dreams immigration agents are chasing her.\n\nSometimes she wishes she would fall asleep and not wake up. Then, she says, the real-life nightmare she's living would end.\n\nAs Rosa tears up, Libby Johnson offers a hug.\n\nRosa smiles. The warm embrace, and the love she's received from Libby and so many others at the church, have given her strength in her darkest hours.\n\nShe's grateful God put so many good people in her path.\n\nThe day Samuel was detained, Libby was one of 27 supporters who were arrested.\n\nAs she rushed to the immigration office that day, she thought of the many hours she'd spent with Rosa, and how important it is to stand up for others and live the morals the church teaches.\n\n\"It's a call,\" she says. \"If you really want to walk your talk, then you need to take risk.\"\n\nTaking a risk to help undocumented immigrants seems to be something more churches in the area are interested in doing after Samuel's arrest, Villegas says. Several new congregations have come forward to say they want to host someone in sanctuary.\n\nHe tells anyone who's interested that they need to be prepared to stick it out for the long haul.\n\n\"This could be multiple years,\" he says, \"because Trump won't change anything.\"\n\nThe hole he left behind\n\nSamuel's room at CityWell is empty, but it's full of reminders of the life that was lived here and the man who is missing.\n\nWedding photos are taped to the armoire door. Notes he took during a Duke Divinity School class are sitting on a nearby table. So is a stack of books he'd been studying. \"Aprenda Ingl\u00e9s para Conversar\" -- Learn English for Conversation -- is at the top.\n\nA sign on the door still says, \"Oliver Family's Home.\"\n\nThe room is still and quiet, but the church's pastor still hears Samuel's voice every time he walks by.\n\nThe music minister thinks of him when he passes by the prayer room across the hall that Samuel -- who'd worked for years as a drywall contractor -- helped build.\n\nUpstairs in the worship hall, someone taped a sign to the wooden chair where Samuel used to sit during services.\n\n\"Samuel's seat,\" it says. \"Keep praying.\"\n\nA sign marks the chair where Samuel Oliver-Bruno used to sit during services at CityWell United Methodist Church. The Rev. Cleve May says his congregation is grieving, but not giving up. \"The story of God in this world is God showing up in the midst of injustice and oppression,\" he says.\n\nThe Sunday after his deportation, Samuel sent the church a video message from Mexico. It was broadcast on TV screens during services.\n\n\"Even though I am in my country, I feel afraid,\" he said. But he added that the North Carolina congregation was still giving him strength.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, I love you all a lot. You will always be with me. Everywhere I go I will talk about all of you, about how much love and support you gave my family.\"\n\nSince Samuel's arrest, CityWell pastor the Rev. Cleve May says he and others have been wrestling with tough questions about the sanctuary movement's future.\n\n\"One of the gambles the sanctuary movement makes is that ICE really doesn't want to kick the hornet's nest of people with privilege,\" May says. \"If you traumatize their church, they're going to throw a real stink. The publicity of this is a deterrent to ICE.\n\n\"It has been thought that the public exposure of sanctuary would serve as a prophylactic to ICE aggression, that surely they wouldn't come somewhere where the light is really bright. I'm not sure we can bank on that anymore.\"\n\nHe sees Samuel's arrest as a violation of sanctuary.\n\nThose who went with Samuel to his appointment were praying and singing religious songs outside the immigration office.\n\n\"For us it was a statement that sanctuary is not a building,\" he says. \"It was people saying to a person, 'You belong with us and we stand with you.'\"\n\nCelebrating the holidays without Samuel is difficult, May says, but darkness and joy can coexist. Grieving the loss has become part of the church's identity.\n\n\"The presence of God doesn't erase the presence of pain,\" he says.\n\nAnd nothing will erase the many ways Samuel shaped the church and his friends there.\n\nIn worship, he says, they're still singing songs Samuel taught them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Church puts fence around Nativity scene to make statement about immigration", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/zefyQ_2qL4I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A church in Oklahoma put a fence around its Nativity scene to send a message: \"The Holy Family Was A Migrant Family.\"\n\nChris Moore, pastor of the Fellowship Congregational Church in Tulsa, said there's a parallel between migrants who come to the US-Mexico border seeking asylum and the Christmas story.

The Supreme Court action also paused fines the company was facing for every day of noncompliance.\n\nThe pause lasts until the court has time to review a response from the government due on or before December 31.\n\nThe request to the Supreme Court is the latest twist in the secret case, much of which is under seal and has made its way through the federal court system with uncommon speed.\n\nThis is the first known legal challenge apparently related to Mueller's investigation to make its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court could separately be asked to hear an appeal of the case.\n\n\"So far as we know, the Court has never had a sealed argument before all nine justices,\" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"They can keep parts of the record and briefing sealed, and often do, such as in cases implicating trade secrets. But there's no procedure in the court's rules for having the whole case briefed, argued and decided under seal. The only times I'm aware of in which parties tried it, the court denied certiorari,\" or the review of the case.\n\nThe company's challenge of the subpoena appears to have begun in September. In its ruling this past week, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia offered few clues about the company and its country of origin or what Mueller's team sought.\n\nIn one short passage in the three-page decision, the judges describe how they had learned confidentially from prosecutors that they had \"reasonable probability\" the records requested involved actions that took place outside of the United States but directly affected the US. Even the company was not informed of what prosecutors had on the issue, because revealing it to the company would have violated the secrecy of the grand jury investigation, the judges said.\n\nThe range of possibilities on the identity of the company is vast. The company could be anything from a sovereign-owned bank to a state-backed technology or information company. Those types of corporate entities have been frequent recipients of requests for information in Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnd though Mueller's work focused on the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors have said and CNN has reported that the Mueller team looked at actions related to Turkish, Ukrainian and other foreign government interests.\n\nMueller previously indicted three Russian companies and 25 Russians for their alleged contributions to a social media propaganda scheme meant to influence American voters and to the hack of the Democratic Party. The special counsel and other Justice Department units continue to pursue several investigations related to Mueller's core mission.\n\nAnother challenge of a Mueller subpoena, from Roger Stone associate Andrew Miller, began at the trial level months before the anonymous company's action apparently began. Miller's case is now before the DC Circuit as well but has not yet been decided by the judges. His case became public after his attorneys publicly spoke about his intention to challenge Mueller and the subpoena.\n\nThe company in the Supreme Court challenge has stayed secret---as has the grand jury proceeding it's related to. And both the company, prosecutors and the circuit court took pains to keep the identities of those involved in the case under wraps.

It is even possible that it could still be underway when the new Congress starts in early January.\n\nHere's a look at the latest on negotiations and the outlook for the partial shutdown:\n\nHow long is the shutdown expected to last?\n\nThe President's incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that \"it is very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress\" during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nA spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told CNN Sunday that \"if Director Mulvaney says the Trump Shutdown will last into the New Year, believe him \u2014 because it's their shutdown.\"\n\nSchumer made a counteroffer on border security, according to a Democratic source familiar with the negotiations -- before Saturday when he met with Vice President Mike Pence -- to Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby and that was rejected by the White House. Pence then made his own offer on Saturday, which was rejected by Schumer.\n\nSchumer and Shelby have been having side discussions, but they don't appear to have yielded much progress given the differences between Schumer and the White House, the source added.\n\nThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no deal to re-open the government, and while there will be a pro forma Senate session on Monday, the next actual session is not scheduled until Thursday.\n\nLawmakers can travel home for Christmas and won't have to worry about being called back to vote until a deal can be reached, but GOP leaders told senators that if there is no deal by Thursday, they would not have to return for that session, sources have told CNN.\n\nWhat are the next possible steps?\n\nThere is a remote possibility that a deal could come together sooner, and in the unlikely event a deal is reached by Monday, the pro forma session could be used to pass it by unanimous consent or voice vote, something that would only require one senator to be in attendance.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have said that the new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will pass a bill to stop the shutdown if it lasts into the new Congress.\n\n\"If President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January,\" the Democratic leaders said in a joint statement after the shutdown started.\n\nWhere do negotiations stand between the President and Democrats?\n\nThe key sticking point in the spending standoff is President Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion for a border wall. And so far, there is still no agreement to resolve the standoff and re-open the government.\n\nHouse Republicans passed a spending bill that included an additional $5 billion for the wall last week, but the legislation is considered dead on arrival in the Senate where Democrats have said they would not support it. Any spending bill needs at least some Democratic votes to pass in the Senate.\n\nVice President Mike Pence proposed spending $2.5 billion on border security, including the wall, in a stopgap spending bill during meetings on Friday night and Saturday afternoon with Schumer, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSeveral of the sources said there were policy additions and restrictions included in the proposal to try to bridge the gap. But Democrats said the number and the details tied to it aren't acceptable.\n\nFollowing the Saturday meeting, a Schumer spokesman said, \"The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we're still very far apart.\"\n\nWhich parts of the government are affected?\n\nKey parts of the federal government have been impacted by the shutdown, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the Interior Department, the State Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut just because a federal department is subject to a lapse in funding, that doesn't mean that all of its activities immediately stop.\n\nTypically in the event of a shutdown, some federal employees deemed essential continue to work, but their pay is withheld until the shutdown is over, while other federal employees are placed on furlough, meaning they are effectively put on a leave of absence without pay. Congress can move to order that furloughed employees be paid retroactively after a shutdown is over, though that is not guaranteed.\n\nSome affected departments have put out information to explain how the shutdown will play out.\n\nThe Agriculture Department said on Twitter that \"we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources.\" A press release issued by the department specified that some of the activities that will not stop at least in the short-term include Forest Service law enforcement and emergency and natural disaster response.\n\nAn administration official told CNN prior to the shutdown began that \"a majority of DHS activities would continue\" if there were a lapse in appropriations.\n\n\"For instance, those protecting our borders with the Customs and Border Patrol will continue to do so,\" the official said.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the Justice Department will be impacted, special counsel Robert Mueller's office will be able to continue working.\n\nMueller's office \"is funded from a permanent indefinite appropriation and would be unaffected in the event of a shutdown,\" a Justice Department spokesperson told CNN previously.\n\nWill the shutdown impact holiday travel?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration will be on the job to screen passengers, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers will be directing planes.\n\nThe FAA released a statement saying that \"air traffic control is fully operational and there is no impact to safety or FAA oversight for travelers.\"\n\nAmtrak, a federally owned corporation rather than a government agency, will be open. Federal Railroad Administration inspectors will also continue to work.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection checkpoints will remain open for international travelers, and the State Department will also continue processing passports.\n\nHow many federal workers will be impacted?\n\nAn estimated 800,000 federal employees may be impacted by the partial shutdown, either by having to work during it while their pay is withheld until it ends or by being furloughed.\n\nMore than 420,000 government workers are expected to work without pay in a partial shutdown, according to a fact sheet released by the Democratic staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThat estimate includes more than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers. In addition, more than 380,000 federal employees would be placed on furlough, according to the fact sheet.\n\nBefore adjourning on Friday, the Senate passed a bill to ensure federal employees who are furloughed get back pay. It was passed by unanimous consent, but still will need to pass the House. The measure was brought up by Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, who represent Maryland, where many DC-area federal employees live."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says Mattis to leave by end of year, announces new acting secretary of defense", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/vA8hxwhrlOY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced on Sunday he would replace Defense Secretary James Mattis at the start of the new year, two months earlier than Mattis' planned departure.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019.

The announcement itself followed Trump's decision to call for a full withdrawal of troops from Syria and consideration of a drawdown in Afghanistan\n\nTrump did not immediately realize how critical Mattis' resignation letter was until some time after the two men ended their Oval Office meeting last week.\n\nAides said the President was relatively relaxed in the aftermath and seemed fine with Mattis' decision to depart. But after Trump announced Mattis' retirement and the Pentagon released Mattis' letter, Trump began watching the coverage and realized the former general was leaving in protest of him -- and not quietly, either.\n\nThe stream of praise that followed from Democrats and Republicans alike irked Trump. He remarked that Mattis was only being portrayed as the smartest guy in the world because he was leaving the Trump administration.\n\nA source close to the White House told CNN's Jim Acosta on Friday that Trump was angry about Mattis' resignation letter. The source said Trump \"hates the letter,\" but \"hates the coverage more.\"\n\nThe source compared the Mattis situation to that of former top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who reportedly sought to circumvent the President at times when Trump was seen as going overboard. But \"(Mattis and Cohn) didn't garner the votes\" in the 2016 election, the source said, Trump did.\n\nMattis' No. 2 to lead Pentagon\n\nShanahan, Trump's choice to replace Mattis on an interim basis, was confirmed as Mattis' No. 2 in the Pentagon last year by an overwhelming margin that came after a confirmation process that included a clash with the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain.\n\nShanahan's portfolio at the Department of Defense has been narrow; he has almost exclusively handled budget issues, internal reform and the Space Force.\n\nHis official biography from the Defense Department notes Shanahan joined Boeing in 1986 and stayed with the major defense contractor for more than three decades. He received an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two higher degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, according to his biography.\n\nSouth Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has called for hearings on Afghanistan and Syria, praised both Mattis and Shanahan via Twitter after Trump's announcement.\n\n\"I think I speak for millions of Americans in thanking Secretary Mattis for a lifetime of exceptional and dedicated service to our nation.

The Senate adjourned on Saturday without an agreement, meaning the shutdown would likely continue past Christmas.\n\nCorker, a retiring senator and frequent Trump critic, said the dispute over border security and Trump's proposed border wall was \"a purposefully contrived fight\" and argued the fight was small in scope compared to a proposed deal earlier this year ahead of a January government shutdown that would have combined greater money at the border along with protection for \"Dreamers.\"\n\n\"We can secure our borders,\" Corker said. \"We can solve this problem.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teens open up on sex to beat 'toxic' masculinity", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/QLFn9dMX3NQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On a warm Saturday afternoon, more than a dozen young men and teenage boys sit on plastic chairs in a yard in their neighborhood.\n\nThey gather to talk about women, respect -- and sex.\n\nIt's a meeting that occurs twice a week in Pankop, a small town in Mpumalanga province, in eastern South Africa.\n\nSome of these young men are virgins, and the group's head, Kabelo Chabalala, is at pains to emphasize that it is OK to be one.\n\n\"There's a lot of toxic masculinity,\" Chabalala, 27, told CNN of the stereotypes portrayed around masculine gender roles in his country.\n\nHe believes that some of this is down to many young men in South Africa growing up without good role models.\n\n\"I realized that growing up without a father figure in my life could have influenced me to make some bad decisions,\" Chabalala said.

In comparison, South Africa's rate for the same year was 9.6 per 100,000 women according to a 2018 report by Statistics South Africa\n\n\"I thought that maybe if we work on how boys and men are socializing, we can have a different generation of men,\" he added. \"Instead of complaining, one could do something positive.\"\n\nYMM members discuss sex during a meeting in Pankop, Mpumalanga province, in South Africa.\n\nIn 2015, Chabalala launched the Young Men Movement, a nonprofit support group creating safe spaces for men to talk about their feelings.\n\nMembers participate in open discussions designed to restore \"a safe environment for women,\" he says. This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise 02:34\n\nThe report wasn't all doom and gloom; it also had some positive findings.\n\n\"Childhood poverty has decreased,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That's a key indicator of somebody's socioeconomic status and a good predictor of how their overall health is going to be for the rest of their life. That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes. What we would like to see is all states improving.\"\n\nHopes for better health in the new year\n\nAs the nation looks toward 2019, Randall said, she has some hopes for public health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"What I hope we will see next year is that some of these trends really start to go in a better direction. As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report. That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year.

Three people who got injections or infusions of umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products at a Texas outpatient clinic on September 12 developed bloodstream infections.\n\nOn September 22, the Florida Department of Health was notified that four people had joint infections after getting injections from a Florida orthopedic clinic between February 15 and August 30. When scientists looked at some of the unopened products at that clinic, they found E. coli and E. faecalis bacteria.\n\nThe report does not offer details on the patient in Arizona. Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product.

He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves.\n\nBut, he added, that with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.\n\nHe confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012.\n\nWhy was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?\n\nThe tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.\n\nSea water did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.\n\nImage copyright Social media Image caption Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit\n\nThe waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing.\n\nMembers of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.\n\nWhat caused the tsunami?\n\nBy Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent\n\nEveryone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous.\n\nIn other words, it's been part of the background.\n\nAnd yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nThe first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano.

He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves.\n\nBut, he added, that with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.\n\nHe confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012.\n\nWhy was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?\n\nThe tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.\n\nSea water did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.\n\nImage copyright Social media Image caption Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit\n\nThe waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing.\n\nMembers of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.\n\nWhat caused the tsunami?\n\nBy Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent\n\nEveryone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous.\n\nIn other words, it's been part of the background.\n\nAnd yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nThe first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions.\n\nHow common are tsunamis in Indonesia?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit\n\nIndonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.\n\nIn September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.\n\nKrakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)\n\nImage copyright Oystein Lund Andersen\n\nIn August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:\n\nMassive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people\n\nThousands more were killed by hot ash\n\nThe eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945\n\nThe eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away\n\nWorld temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year\n\nThe volcanic island virtually disappeared\n\nAre you in the affected area?

It's a job usually held by politicians with military oversight experience.\n\nMeanwhile, the president appears to be trying to douse the fire that started this personnel crisis. He also tweeted on Sunday that the US withdrawal from Syria - abruptly announced last week - would be \"slow and highly coordinated\".\n\nGiven the Mattis news, that may not be enough to calm the nerves of allies and assuage the anger of US foreign policy hands. It is, however, a start.\n\nGen Mattis resigned shortly after President Trump announced his decision to withdraw all US troops from Syria.\n\nWhile not mentioning it in his resignation letter directly, the general previously warned that it would be a \"strategic blunder\".\n\nIn his letter, he also said the president had the right to appoint someone \"whose views are better aligned with yours\".\n\nBut shortly after announcing Mr Shanahan's appointment on Sunday, Mr Trump moved to calm widespread concerns over the pullout which he initially said would be \"rapid\".\n\nMr Trump said on Twitter that he had spoken with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about \"our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow and highly coordinated withdrawal of US troops from the area\".\n\nMr Erdogan's office said the two leaders had agreed to \"ensure coordination between their countries' military, diplomatic and other officials to avoid a power vacuum which could result following any abuse of the withdrawal and transition phase in Syria\".\n\nKurdish forces in Syria, which Turkey regards as a threat, have been successfully fighting the Islamic State group with US support.\n\nThey now fear Turkey will use America's withdrawal to launch a new campaign against them."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Yanxi Palace: The most Googled show on Earth", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-46630781", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:24", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright IQiyi Image caption The Story of Yanxi Palace revolves around its female protagonist, Wei Yingluo\n\nIt has love but also hatred, intrigue, revenge, poisoning rivals and even killing babies.\n\nThe Chinese drama Story of Yanxi Palace is the most Googled TV show of 2018 globally, despite Google being largely blocked in the country.\n\nThe search engine's analytics suggested that the top interest in the drama has come from Asian regions like Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Hong Kong, but its popularity in mainland China has been overwhelming as well.\n\nThe series has been streamed more than 15 billion times on iQiyi, China's Netflix-like site where the show premiered in July before it reached domestic TV channels and more than 70 markets abroad.

But its own uniqueness has made it the undisputed entertainment sensation of the year.\n\nHere's how it took over China and its neighbouring regions.\n\nIt catches up with a trend of feminist shows\n\nThe heroine of the show, Wei Yingluo, is unlike most traditional Chinese female characters who are taught to be tolerant, submissive and fragile.\n\nInspired by the actual real-life consort of Emperor Qianlong, the story follows Yingluo as a woman of Chinese Han ethnicity in the Qing dynasty - the last imperial dynasty in China ruled by the Manchurian ethnicity that suppressed the Han people.\n\nBut her intelligence, determination and appropriate ferocity meant she was eventually granted her the title of imperial noble consort, the highest possible position for a Han person at that time.\n\nYingluo's most famous line from the show goes like this : \"I, Wei Yingluo, am naturally hot-tempered and not to be pushed around. Whoever keeps talking [nonsense], I have all kinds of methods to go against her.\"\n\nImage copyright IQiyi Image caption Wei Yingluo started off as a servant in the palace but slowly worked her way up\n\nThe woman she is based on - Xiaoyichun - was posthumously given the title of empress, making her the only Han empress during the Manchu-reigned dynasty.\n\nThe show comes as the latest example of how feminist-themed soap operas have captured Chinese audiences.\n\nOther shows like The Legend of Zhenhuan - another imperial rising-up-the-ranks story bought by Netflix - and The Empress of China, that tells the story of the only female emperor in Chinese history, have also taken off in China.\n\nIt didn't face much censorship\n\nBefore the show aired on TV screens, it was shown online.\n\nThe co-producer and initial distributor of the series, iQiyi, is one of China's most popular online video platforms - helping the show gain large traffic and, more importantly, easier regulatory scrutiny for its debut.\n\nIn China, the National Radio and Television Administration oversees all content on radio and television. A TV project has to obtain the go-ahead from it even before shooting starts.\n\nWhen video sites emerged a few years ago, they could publish anything as long as they thought it was within the regulator's rules.\n\nIn 2016, an online series featuring gay love went viral but was taken off in the middle of the streaming season. A year later, a a ban on homosexual content was issued.\n\nOnline video platforms can't broadcast shows at will but the censorship they go through is much lighter than TV channels, which are mostly owned by the government.\n\nLow-cost cast, high-quality production\n\nNo actor in the show is very famous, except for one Hong Kong actress, Charmaine Sheh, who was willing to play a supporting role.\n\nGong Yu, founder and CEO of iQiyi, said the company had \"deliberately cast lesser known actors... rejecting recent trends in the Chinese industry that put too much emphasis of the celebrity appeal of actors in their productions\".\n\nIt came at an essential time when Chinese celebrities' high income and ambiguous tax practices had caught the attention of the authorities.\n\nTotal spending on the show's cast didn't even reach one tenth of the total production cost, according to Chinese magazine Portrait citing series producer Yu Zheng, who added that the rest of the money was mainly spent on things like costume and make-up.\n\nImage copyright IQiyi Image caption The detailed costumes and intricate sets won over audiences\n\nThe well-built sets, elaborate costumes, make-up and attention to detail have won viewers' love.\n\nFor example, concubines in the show wear three earrings on each side, as was the tradition of Manchu women at that time.\n\nSo if you've never heard of Yanxi Palace, you could try Googling it - you wouldn't be the first."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Chris Dawson: Husband in podcast mystery released on bail", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46669900", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPA Image caption Australian Chris Dawson is accused of murdering his wife who vanished in 1982\n\nThe husband of Lynette Dawson, a Sydney woman whose disappearance has been the subject of a popular crime podcast, has been released on bail after his arrest for her alleged murder.\n\nThe 70-year-old denies killing his wife, saying that she abandoned the family for a religious group in 1982.\n\nThe story of her disappearance is told in Australian podcast The Teacher's Pet, which secured a global following.\n\nChris Dawson was greeted by a media throng upon exiting jail on Monday.\n\nHe posted A$1.5m (\u00a3850,000; $1.05m) bail and will return to his family home in the state of Queensland, where he will have to surrender his passport and report daily to authorities.\n\nImage copyright SUPPLIED Image caption Lynette Dawson, a mother of two, was last seen in 1982\n\nPolice arrested the former high school teacher on 5 December, following a three-year re-investigation of the cold case.\n\nNo trace of Mrs Dawson has ever been found since she vanished from the couple's Sydney home 36 years ago.\n\nHer husband had been having an affair with the family's babysitter, one of his students, at the time of her disappearance, an inquest in 2003 found.\n\nThat inquest and another also concluded that she was killed by a \"known person\".

That breaks down to a larger deficit of \u00a395bn for goods, but a surplus of \u00a328bn for services.\n\nSo in total, the amount of exports potentially at risk from new trade barriers is greater for the 27 than for the UK.\n\nBut that is a rather crude measure of how much each side has to lose.\n\nLet's take another example to illustrate the point.\n\nWhat does Andorra have to do with Brexit?\n\nThe EU - with a population of more than half a billion and an annual economic activity or GDP of around \u00a315 trillion - has a trade surplus with Andorra, which has a population of about 80,000 and GDP of less than \u00a33bn.\n\nDoes that mean that the EU needs Andorra more than Andorra needs the EU? It would, of course, be an absurd suggestion.\n\nWhy? Because the EU's economy is so much larger.\n\nFor sure, disruptions to that trade would be a serious problem for some Spanish and French businesses and jobs near the border. But for the EU economy as a whole the impact would be tiny.\n\nNow to state the obvious, the UK is not Andorra. It matters far more to the EU as an export market than Andorra does.\n\nThat said, a more revealing measure of what is at stake is to look at the amount of trade exposed to some risk of new barriers as a percentage of either a country's total exports or GDP.\n\nTake goods first, as goods and services data is generally collected differently and is often published separately.\n\nThe EU 27 accounts for 48% of UK exports of goods, and 8% of GDP (in 2017, from the European Commission database).\n\nWhen we look at the share of the EU's exports going to the UK there is a choice to make about whether to include trade among the remaining 27 EU countries in total goods exports. If we do include it, the UK share is 6.2%; if we don't it's 18% of the total. UK exports account for 2.3% of the EU 27 GDP.\n\nYou sometimes hear the suggestion that these figures miss an important point because the two biggest players in the EU, Germany and France, are the true political driving forces in the EU. So are they any more reliant on the UK market than the EU average?\n\nFor Germany, the figures are 6.6% of goods exports going to the UK, accounting for 2.6% of GDP. The latter figure is slightly above the EU average.\n\nFor France, the equivalent figures are 6.7% of exports and 1.4% of GDP, the latter comfortably below the average for the EU as a whole.\n\nThe countries that do have a relatively large exposure to the UK are Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nAnd what about Germany's carmakers? They didn't show up for battle in the way David Davis hoped. The head of Germany's car industry association Matthias Wissman said last year: \"however important the United Kingdom is to us as a market, the cohesion of the EU 27 and their single market are even more important to our industry\".\n\nThat said, the UK would be a leading export market for the EU 27. For goods in 2017 it was very slightly behind the US, but well ahead of the next largest China. But it is important to remember: internal trade within the EU is really big for the 27.\n\nCould the 'Rotterdam effect' complicate the picture?\n\nThere is a significant complication underneath these figures, sometimes known as the Rotterdam effect.\n\nExports are generally recorded as going to their first destination. So if a container goes initially to Rotterdam in the Netherlands (or Antwerp in Belgium or some other ports) and is then transferred for onward transport to somewhere else, it is nonetheless recorded as an export to (or an import from) the Netherlands (or another EU country).\n\nIt has proved impossible to quantify this effect with any real precision. It affects figures for trade going into the UK and out.\n\nBut even if we make some fairly extreme guesses about its magnitude, the UK still exports more as a share of its own GDP to the EU 27 than the other way round.\n\nWhat about services?\n\nFor the services trade, the case is even clearer.\n\nThe UK economy is both smaller than the EU's and has a services trade surplus.\n\nIn 2016, services exports to the EU were 7.2% of UK GDP; for the EU 27 services exports to the UK were 1.1% of their GDP.\n\nAll these figures point in the same direction. The UK looks more exposed in the event of disruption to trade relations.\n\nThat is not to say the impact on the EU would be trivial, far from it.\n\nThe EU 27 would undoubtedly face significant economic harm from major disturbances to their trade with the UK. But on the basis of the trade data, the \"they need us more\" claim looks very shaky.\n\nOne point to add about the data. You may see figures elsewhere that are somewhat different.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in the way trade data are put together in different countries.\n\nSome of the figures involve converting currencies and exchange rates vary. And there variations from year to year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Gavin Williamson: UK ship in Ukraine 'sends message to Russia'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46657470", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:00:45", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption HMS Echo docked in the Black Sea on Friday, before Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson visited\n\nA Royal Navy warship which has been sent to Ukraine will send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's defence secretary says.\n\nHMS Echo was sent into the Black Sea earlier this month, after Russia seized three ships belonging to Ukraine's navy and their crews.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson has visited the ship in the port of Odessa.\n\nHe said the presence of the British ship shows support for Ukraine in the face of increased Russian aggression.\n\nIt will be followed by other warships as part of a more constant British presence, he said.\n\nNato has recently stepped up its operations in the Black Sea with increased warship patrols.\n\nThere are increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine over access to the area off the coast of Crimea.\n\nCrimea used to be part of an independent Ukraine, but it was annexed by Russia in 2014.

officials have announced.\n\nThe surgery involves repairing the spinal tissue of the baby while it is still in the womb.\n\nIt can improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida.\n\nThe procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards.\n\n\"We'll be working with TSC clinics across England to help them get ready to prescribe this drug to more people who can benefit from it.\"\n\nThe

in sugar and salt.\n\nChief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds.\n\nIn her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food.\n\nThe food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour.\n\nDame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.\n\nIt represents a

But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop.\"\n\nBut the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability.\n\n\"We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,\" an RCGP official said.\n\nIs it safe to wait weeks for an appointment?\n\nSome patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\n\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them.\n\n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\n\nAre all practices affected?\n\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice.\"\n\nIs there anything that will help?\n\nGPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist.\n\nThere are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with.\n\nTechnology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly.\n\nBut Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff.\n\nBetter funding was key though. \"If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to embrace general practice.\"\n\nWhat's your experience of booking a routine appointment with your GP or practice nurse?

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Warning against 'volcano tourism' risks", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46621304", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThrill-seeking tourists are putting themselves in danger and hampering emergency services by heading towards volcanoes when they erupt.\n\nA report from the Royal Geographical Society warns of the growing risks caused by \"volcano tourism\".\n\nEmergency authorities in countries such as Iceland now have to contend with the arrival of tourists who rush there to get close to an exploding volcano.\n\nThe study says such tourists fail to understand the seriousness of the risk.\n\nThe study, published by the Royal Geographical Society and written by University of Cambridge geographer Amy Donovan, warns that such visitors can create dangerous problems for already stretched rescue services.\n\n'Volcanophiles'\n\nThe phenomenon of \"volcano tourism\" has seen thousands of people trying to get close to the site of erupting volcanoes for the physical experience of seeing, hearing and feeling the heat of such a natural spectacle.\n\nDr Donovan says that such people are fascinated by the elemental power of volcanoes and are attracted by such an intense experience.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption How close is too close for tourists chasing volcanoes?\n\n\"You can breathe the gas, hear the sounds the earth is making.

You can't police the site of a volcano at night.\n\n\"Many active volcanic countries face the dilemma of wanting tourists, but also wanting to keep people safe, which creates a difficult conundrum,\" said Dr Donovan."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Study: Most Concussions Can Be Prevented By Wearing Second Helmet", "article_link": "https://sports.theonion.com/study-most-concussions-can-be-prevented-by-wearing-sec-1831266194", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

Earlier in the day, there was a tense calm as schools and universities were shuttered by a nation-wide government suspension and riot police equipped with batons and tear gas guarded buildings.\n\n\"We were asked to leave this morning,\" said a university student from northern Khartoum.\n\nSudanese queued outside bakeries in the city, where vendors were refusing to sell more than 20 loaves of bread per person.\n\n\"I have a big family and this bread is not enough for three daily meals,\" a local resident told AFP.\n\nA bakery worker said a security guard standing nearby was not allowing the shop to sell any more.\n\nDoctors strike\n\nDoctors are also set to go on strike on Monday in the first of a series of work stoppages, announced by an umbrella coalition of professional unions.\n\nIn a statement, the coalition said the doctors will continue to deal with emergencies during the strike, which aims to \"paralyse\" the government and deny it much-needed revenues. The coalition also called on citizens to continue their street protests.\n\nThere have also been calls by a number of independent trade and professional unions for a general strike on Wednesday.\n\nSara Abdelgalil, president of the Sudan Doctors' Union in the UK, said Sudan is headed for a total shutdown if there's no change in leadership, calling the recent protests \"the tip of the iceberg\".\n\n\"I don't think people on the streets are protesting just because of fuel and bread. They are protesting because there is an overall failure of the whole system,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"For the medical sector, there is complete destruction for the infrastructure, for the access of health services, for the cost of treatment, for the absence of life-saving medication, so the health sector is similar to education and other sectors in Sudan where there is an overall failure from the current government, therefore they have to step down and hand over the power to a government that can lead and can provide a better life for the people of Sudan,\" added Abdelgalil.\n\nParticipants in the protests have so far numbered in the hundreds or low thousands in each location but their continuation for nearly a week despite the use of force by police suggests the level of popular discontent over al-Bashir's rule is at a dangerously high level. Sudan's official news agency SUNA reported on Sunday that authorities had arrested a \"cell of saboteurs\" which had planned \"acts of vandalism in the capital\".\n\nThe official outlet said the \"cell\" includes members opposition groups but did not elaborate.\n\nSadiq Youssef from the opposition coalition, the National Consensus Forces alliance, had said earlier that 14 members of his group, including its president Farouk Abu Issa, were arrested as they left a meeting.\n\nA group bringing together representatives of different professions called in a statement on Sunday for a series of strikes over the price rise, starting with hospitals from Monday.\n\n\"This crisis can't be left to the government to solve alone, other political parties need to come in and join hands to find a way out,\" Abu Alqasim Idris, economic analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The crisis is no longer an economy crisis, it's now a political crisis and people are blaming the government for it.\"\n\nEconomic struggles\n\nAnger has been rising across Sudan over the rising costs of bread and fuel and other economic hardships, including skyrocketing inflation and limits on bank withdrawals.\n\nThe country's economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three-quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - since South Sudan seceded in 2011, keeping most of the oilfields.\n\nSudan's economic woes have been exacerbated in the past few years, even as the United States lifted its 20-year-old trade sanctions on the country in October 2017.\n\nThe US has kept Sudan on its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which prevents Khartoum from accessing much-needed financial aid from institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nBread prices have more than tripled since the start of this year after a government decision to stop state-funded imports of wheat.\n\nOfficials had hoped the move would create competition between private companies importing wheat, and therefore, act as a check on price rises.\n\nBut a number of bakeries stopped production, citing a lack of flour. This forced the government to increase flour subsidies by 40 percent in November.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of the Sudanese pound has slumped by 85 percent against the US dollar this year, while inflation soared to nearly 70 percent in September.\n\nIn October, Sudan sharply devalued its currency from 29 pounds to the dollar to 47.5 after a body of banks and money changers set the country's exchange rate.\n\nThe move led to further price increases and a liquidity crunch, while the gap between the official and black market rates has continued to widen.\n\nThe economic crisis is one of the biggest tests faced by al-Bashir, who took power in a coup in 1989.\n\nIn recent months, he has dissolved the government, named a new central bank governor and brought in a package of reforms, but the moves have done little to improve the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar has offered its support to al-Bashir, according to Sudan's state news agency.\n\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke to al-Bashir on the phone on Saturday and pledged Qatar's \"readiness to provide all that is needed to help Sudan get through this crisis\", the Sudanese state news agency reported."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Indonesia on alert as death toll from devastating tsunami rises", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/indonesia-alert-devastating-tsunami-kills-hundreds-181224022646696.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Rescue workers are stepping up efforts to reach many areas devastated by a deadly tsunami that hit an Indonesian strait almost without warning in the darkness, smashing into houses, hotels and other buildings.\n\nAs doctors worked to help survivors and hundreds of people searched on debris-strewn beaches along the Sunda Strait for more victims, Indonesian officials said on Monday morning that the death toll had risen to at least 281, with 1,016 injured.\n\nDozens are missing from the disaster areas along the coastlines of western Java and southern Sumatra islands. The numbers could increase once authorities hear from all stricken areas.\n\nThe waves that swept terrified people into the sea on Saturday night followed an eruption and possible landslide on Anak Krakatoa, a volcanic island that emerged from the sea in the 1920s.\n\nGovernment and non-government aid trickled in to Pandeglang, the worst-affected area on Java's west coast.

After I opened the door, water came in quickly and dragged me out. When I saw outside, the sea was receding. I decided to run and go as the water came again for the second time,\" she said.\n\nThe widespread damage became apparent after daybreak on Sunday. Nine hotels and hundreds of homes were heavily damaged by the waves.\n\nBroken chunks of concrete and splintered sticks of wood littered hard-hit coastal areas, turning beach getaways popular with Jakarta residents into near ghost towns. Debris from thatch-bamboo shacks was strewn along beaches.\n\nYellow, orange and black body bags were laid out, and weeping relatives identified the dead.\n\nDramatic video shows tsunami crashing into rock concert in Indonesia. pic.twitter.com/oqxfQ7y3zu \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) December 23, 2018\n\nDramatic TV footage showed how the tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing for hundreds of guests at an end-of-year party for state utility company PLN.\n\nAt least four band members and support crew were killed, the group's lead singer told followers in a tearful Instagram account. The band's drummer was among the missing. Another 29 PLN employees and relatives were also killed.\n\n'Ring of fire'\n\nScientists, including those from Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, said the tsunami could have been caused by landslides - either above ground or under water - on the steep slope of the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano. The scientists also cited tidal waves caused by the full moon.\n\nThe 305-metre-high Anak Krakatoa, whose name means \"Child of Krakatoa\", lies on an island in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands, linking the Indian Ocean and the Java Sea. It has been erupting since June and did so again about 24 minutes before the tsunami, the geophysics agency said.\n\nThe volcanic island formed over years after the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, one of the largest, most devastating in recorded history. That disaster killed more than 30,000 people, launched far-reaching tsunamis and created so much ash that day was turned to night in the area and a global temperature drop was recorded.\n\nMost of the island sank into a volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site. It continues to grow each year and erupts periodically.\n\nGegar Prasetya, a cofounder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, said Saturday's tsunami was likely caused by a flank collapse - when a big section of a volcano's slope gives way. It's possible for an eruption to trigger a landslide above ground or beneath the ocean, both capable of producing waves, he said.\n\n\"Actually, the tsunami was not really big, only one metre,\" said Prasetya, who has studied Krakatoa. \"The problem is people always tend to build everything close to the shoreline.\"\n\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the \"Ring of Fire\", an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.

More recently, it has been spewing ash and lava since June.\n\nExperts say the tsunami, or seismic sea wave, was likely caused by the collapse of a big portion of Anak Krakatoa's southern flank. They believe this triggered underwater landslides which displaced water to create the large, killer waves.\n\n\"Underwater landside is the leading theory,\" Sam Taylor-Offord, a seismologist at GNS Science in Wellington, said on Monday.\n\n\"So when that land pushes into the ocean ... it displaces the ocean surface causing the vertical displacement that causes the tsunami,\" he added, noting however that the lack of data and access made it impossible to ascertain this theory.\n\nBen van der Pluijm, an earthquake geologist and professor at the University of Michigan, also said the tsunami may have been caused by Anak Krakatoa's partial collapse.\n\n\"Instability of the slope of an active volcano can create a rock slide that moves a large volume of water, creating local tsunami waves that can be very powerful. This is like suddenly dropping a bag of sand in a tub filled with water,\" he said.\n\n'1883 explosion heard around the world'\n\nAnak Krakatoa formed over years after the explosive eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in 1883, one of the largest and most catastrophic in recorded history.\n\nBefore 1883, the only confirmed eruption on the Krakatoa island group was a moderate one, some two centuries before, in 1680.\n\n181223103309361\n\nBut at 1pm on August 26, 1883, the first in a series of increasingly violent explosions sent a black cloud of ash 27km above Krakatoa.\n\nThe climax was reached at 10am the following day, with tremendous blasts that were heard some 3,500km away in Australia, ash that reached a height of 80km and a series of powerful, far-reaching tsunamis - the event was described as \"the explosion heard around the world\".\n\nSome 36,000 people were killed in Java and Sumatra in the tsunamis that followed the volcano's collapse, with the greatest wave reaching a height of 37 metres.\n\n'Child of Krakatoa'\n\nKrakatoa's discharge sent nearly 21 cubic km of rock fragments into the air, while large quantities of ash fell over an area of some 800,000 square km - as a result, the region surrounding the volcano was plunged into darkness for more than two days.\n\nThe dust drifted several times around the globe, creating dramatic red and orange sunsets throughout the following year. A global temperature drop was also recorded.\n\nA thick layer of sterile ash meanwhile covered everything on Krakatoa, and plant and animal life did not begin to reestablish itself for five years.\n\nKrakatoa remained quiet until December 1927, when a new eruption started on the seafloor along the same line as the previous ones. In early 1928, a rising cone reached sea level, and by 1930 it had become a small island - Anak Krakatoa, or \"child of Krakatoa\".\n\nAnak Krakatoa's cone has continued to grow ever since, and it's currently standing at an elevation of about 300 metres above the sea.\n\nWith the exact cause of the disaster still unknown, and Anak Krakotoa still rumbling, authorities and scientists are wary of the risk of a tsunami recurrence.\n\n\"The likelihood of further tsunamis in the Sunda Strait will remain high while Anak Krakatoa volcano is going through its current active phase because that might trigger further submarine landslides,\u201d Richard Teeuw, of the University of Portsmouth in England, said.\n\nTeeuw said that sonar surveys would now be needed to map the seafloor around the volcano, but \"unfortunately submarine surveys typically take many months to organise and carry out,\" he added.\n\nBut \"devastating tsunami caused by volcanic eruptions are rare; one of the most famous (and deadly) was caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Lebanon: Palestinian boy, 3, dies after 'hospitals refuse care'", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/lebanon-palestinian-boy-3-dies-hospitals-refuse-care-181223081520826.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Beirut, Lebanon - A three-year-old Palestinian boy died after hospitals across Lebanon allegedly refused to provide him with a bed in an intensive care unit.\n\nMohammed Wehbe suffered from a serious brain condition and urgently needed treatment after his condition worsened.\n\nHe was admitted to Tripoli's Islamic Hospital on December 14.

He added that the child's condition had deteriorated beyond the scope for successful treatment and reached a \"very advanced\" stage, which led to his death.\n\nUmm Mohammed however still believes that whether it was due to the family's lack of money, his Palestinian identity, or a lack of medical facilities, Lebanon failed her son.\n\n\"My son is sleeping in peace now away from the heartless people in this country,\" she said."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:14", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Family Reunites in Home Made of Shipping Containers", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713592.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "This will be a special holiday season for a father who was homeless and his five children.

But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement. And drug trials toward the end of the West Africa outbreak produced evidence about the vaccine that\u2019s now being deployed.\n\nBut pregnant women weren\u2019t included in those trials, and researchers collected little in the way of data about the burden pregnant women and their offspring face.\n\n\u201cPregnant women are continuously getting left out of the benefits of scientific advancement in medicine,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to fail to collect the kinds of data that we need, to generate the kind of evidence that we need and to also have interventions that meet the broader population\u2019s needs,\u201d Krubiner said, \u201cthen we\u2019re just going to continue to perpetuate the cycle.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "California Researchers Working on Tomorrow's Battery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713596.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Batteries have been around for hundreds of years, but don't go thinking this technology is old hat (old fashioned).

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Rescuers Dig Through Rubble For Survivors After Indonesian Tsunami Kills 280", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesian-tsunami-kills-280_us_5c20503ae4b08aaf7a8a54b1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "LABUAN, Indonesia, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The death toll from a tsunami triggered by a massive underwater landslide on an Indonesian volcano rose to 281 on Monday, as rescuers using heavy machinery and their bare hands searched through debris in the hope of finding survivors.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s meteorological agency confirmed the collapse of part of Anak Krakatau, a volcano midway between Java and Sumatra, caused a tsunami 6-10 feet high that hit the rim of the Sunda Strait late on Saturday.\n\nAt least 1,000 people were injured and nearly 12,000 coastal residents forcibly evacuated to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday.\n\nGetty Editorial The death toll from Sunday's tsunami neared 300 today.\n\nAnak Krakatau, which means child of Krakatau, has been spewing ash and lava for months.

The tsunami apparently caused by the eruption of an island volcano killed a number of people around Indonesia's Sunda Strait, sending a wall of water crashing some 65 feet inland and sweeping away hundreds of houses including hotels, the government and witnesses said.\n\nScientists, including those from Indonesia\u2019s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, said the tsunami could have been caused by landslides \u2014 either above ground or under water \u2014 on the steep slope of the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano. The scientists also cited tidal waves caused by the full moon.\n\nThe 305-meter (1,000-foot) -high Anak Krakatau, whose name means \u201cChild of Krakatoa,\u201d lies on an island in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands, linking the Indian Ocean and the Java Sea. It has been erupting since June and did so again about 24 minutes before the tsunami, the geophysics agency said.\n\nThe volcanic island formed over years after the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, one of the largest, most devastating in recorded history. That disaster killed more than 30,000 people, launched far-reaching tsunamis and created so much ash that day was turned to night in the area and a global temperature drop was recorded.\n\nMost of the island sank into a volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site. It continues to grow each year and erupts periodically although it is much smaller than Krakatoa.\n\nGegar Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, said Saturday\u2019s tsunami was likely caused by a flank collapse \u2014 when a big section of a volcano\u2019s slope gives way. It\u2019s possible for an eruption to trigger a landslide above ground or beneath the ocean, both capable of producing waves, he said.\n\n\u201cActually, the tsunami was not really big, only 1 meter (3.3 feet),\u201d said Prasetya, who has studied Krakatoa. \u201cThe problem is people always tend to build everything close to the shoreline.\u201d\n\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas of the disaster-prone country, making access difficult in the best of conditions.\n\nSaturday\u2019s tsunami also rekindled memories of the massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake that hit Indonesia on Dec. 26, 2004. It spawned a giant tsunami off Sumatra island, killing more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries \u2014 the majority in Indonesia.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "HuffPost Her Stories: Hundreds Of Women Accuse Celebrity Spiritual Healer Of Sex Crimes", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-her-stories-celebrity-spiritual-leader-brazil-sex-crimes-allegations_us_5c1d4b5ce4b0407e907ae92d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "EVARISTO SA via Getty Images Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria (center), known as \u201cJo\u00e3o de Deus,\u201d or John of God, is escorted by supporters as he arrives at his \u201chealing center\u201d Abadiania, Brazil, on Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cHuffPost Her Stories\u201d is a new series highlighting HuffPost\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s lives from across our 15 global editions.

In a matter of days, more than 500 women filed complaints against Faria, leading authorities to arrest him Dec. 16 and charge him Dec. 20 with \u201csexual violation through fraud,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nHuffPost Brazil decided to make this the focus of its coverage. \u201cWe have chosen, first of all, to emphasize the importance of women\u2019s denunciations [against Faria],\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. \u201cWe know that specifically in Brazil, cases of sexual violence are underreported for a number of reasons \u2014 among them not only shame and fear, but also the fact that powerful men are involved.\u201d\n\nThe swift investigation into Faria highlights how important it is for survivors to report their abusers and the collective power of women\u2019s voices, Andrea said.\n\n\u201cI think this is the main nuance that this case brings: The voice of women strengthens the denunciations [against Faria] and provides a basis for a solid investigation against a man who, according to them, committed a series of violent acts in moments of fragility as they searched for connection with the divine.\u201d\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nCourtesy of Tila House\n\nEarlier this year, ARTnews Magazine devoted an issue to the status of women in the art world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it revealed staggering gender gaps in the prices artists fetch at auction, as well as in opportunities to show and sell work. Black women have even less of a presence in the art world, representing just 4 percent of artists at leading U.S. fine art institutions, HuffPost U.S. reported. But one artist is aiming to change that. HuffPost U.S. spoke this week with Tiffany LaTrice, the founder of an Atlanta-based arts incubator, co-working and gallery space devoted to empowering black women artists. Tila Studios is already making an impact: It raised enough money this year to send 10 black women artists to Miami\u2019s Art Basel, one of the largest commercial art fairs in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to disrupt the traditional and kind of stale industry that hasn\u2019t really seen a lot of shakeup,\u201d LaTrice said. \u201cSo [we went] down there to kind of shake things up.\u201d\n\nChatiyanon via Getty Images\n\nBoth HuffPost U.S. and HuffPost Canada reported this week on proposals that would make menstrual hygiene products available to more women who can\u2019t afford them. The U.S. Senate passed a criminal justice reform bill on Tuesday that, among other things, would require federal prisons to provide quality pads and tampons to inmates for free. The going rate for a pair of tampons in U.S. prisons is $5.55(!) \u2014 beyond what most inmates can afford, HuffPost U.S. reported. Meanwhile, in Canada, two drugstores in downtown Toronto are preparing to offer free menstrual products to homeless and low-income women. \u201cUntil 2015, Canada treated menstrual products as taxable \u2018luxury items,\u2019\u201d the article notes.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., argued instead for increasing the use of technology along the border instead of building \u201csome medieval wall.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he\u2019s willing to increase the price tag as long as the money is not spent on a wall, Durbin responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nA stalemate over the wall led parts of the government to shut down Saturday after funding for numerous departments and agencies expired. The closure, affecting hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country, was expected to last at least through late this week after the House and Senate, which each met in a rare weekend session, adjourned until Thursday.\n\nMonday and Tuesday, Christmas Eve and Christmas, respectively, are federal holidays, meaning the federal government would already be closed. Wednesday is the first day the public could begin to feel the effects of a shutdown, Mulvaney said.\n\nHe predicted it could extend into January, when Democrats will assume control of the House based on their midterm election gains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nJustin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, countered: \u201cIf Director Mulvaney says the Trump Shutdown will last into the New Year, believe him, because it\u2019s their shutdown.\u201d\n\nDemocrats held firm Sunday in opposition to a wall, which Trump promised his political base would build. Mulvaney said that \u201cthe president\u2019s not going to not accept money for a border wall.\u201d\n\nTrump faced resistance from some Republicans. Retiring Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has criticized Trump on other issues, called the battle for border wall funding a \u201cmade-up fight so the president can look like he\u2019s fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that is unnecessary. It\u2019s a spectacle. And, candidly, it\u2019s juvenile. The whole thing is juvenile,\u201d Corker said in arguing for real measures that he maintains will secure the border better than a wall.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday, the shutdown\u2019s second day, that what\u2019s needed is \u201ca good old fashioned WALL that works,\u201d not aerial drones or other measures that \u201care wonderful and lots of fun\u201d but not the answer to address drugs, gangs, human trafficking and other criminal elements entering the country.\n\nAcross the country, the shutdown played out in uneven ways. The Statue of Liberty remained open for tours, thanks to New York state, and the U.S. Postal Service, an independent agency, was still delivering mail.\n\nBut the routines of 800,000 federal employees were about to be disrupted. More than half are deemed essential and are expected to work without pay, through retroactive pay is expected. Another 380,000 were to be furloughed, meaning they will not report to work but would be paid later. Legislation ensuring that workers receive back pay was expected to clear Congress.\n\nTrump was staying in Washington for Christmas because of the shutdown, the White House said.\n\nWith Democrats set to take control of the House on Jan. 3, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., retiring from Congress, the shutdown provided a last gasp for the conservative majority before the new Congress.\n\nTrump had savored the prospect of a shutdown over the wall. He recently said he\u2019d be \u201cproud\u201d to close down the government and has gone back on his pledge to not blame Democrats for the closure.\n\nHe had campaigned on the promise of building the wall and forcing Mexico to pay for it. Mexico has refused.\n\nSchumer and Vice President Mike Pence met Saturday at the request of the White House, according to Schumer\u2019s office. But the senator\u2019s spokesman said they remained \u201cvery far apart\u201d on a spending agreement.\n\nSchumer said the \u201cTrump shutdown\u201d could end immediately if the president abandons the wall.\n\nDemocrats said they were open to proposals that didn\u2019t include the wall, which Schumer said was too costly and ineffective. They have offered to keep spending at existing levels of $1.3 billion for border fencing and other security.\n\nSenators approved a bipartisan deal earlier in the week to keep the government open into February and provide $1.3 billion for border security projects, but not the wall. But as Trump faced criticism from conservatives for \u201ccaving\u201d on a campaign promise, he pushed the House to approve a package temporarily financing the government but also setting aside $5.7 billion for the border wall.\n\nThe impasse blocked money for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice.\n\nThose being furloughed included nearly everyone at NASA and 52,000 workers at the Internal Revenue Service. Many national parks were expected to close.\n\nThe Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services are among those that Congress has fully funded and will operate as usual. Also still functioning were the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard.\n\nTransportation Security Administration officers continue to staff airport checkpoints and air traffic controllers were on the job."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Spent His Weekend Calling Top Bank Execs Post Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-mnuchin-banks-statement-twitter_us_5c20256be4b0407e907c6165", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that he called the heads of the six largest U.S. banks following a tumultuous week that saw a dive in the stock market and partial government shutdown.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday, Mnuchin said that each of the CEOs \u201cconfirmed they have ample liquidity for lending to consumer, business markets and all other market operations.\u201d\n\nToday I convened individual calls with the CEOs of the nation's six largest banks.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who opposed the move, announced his resignation a day later. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, also resigned in protest.\n\nBut Mulvaney on Sunday shrugged off the resounding condemnation of Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal. \u201cThe fact that his decision is not popular with some people is more their problem than his,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Doctor's Note Policies Punish Students For Being Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-doctors-note-policies-poverty_us_5c1bfc6fe4b05c88b6f66933", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s said that during the holidays, all roads lead home \u2015 or, for those who have access, to the doctor.\n\nThe holiday season is like being invited to a white elephant gift exchange only to find out that each beautifully wrapped box contains a different variation of stomach virus, cold, strep or the flu. Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Health Care In Texas Is A Nightmare For Women Restaurant Workers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-restaurant-workers-sexual-health-care_us_5c1a7690e4b0446830f95b5c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Emily Jaschke Texas is one of the worst states for reproductive health. Chef and restaurant owner Erin Smith founded a group that aims to help women access affordable reproductive care.\n\nBeing a woman in the restaurant industry has its challenges \u2015 from sexual harassment, to unfair compensation to inadequate access to health insurance. Being a woman in the restaurant industry in Texas presents a whole additional set of obstacles.\n\nJust 14 percent of restaurant employees across the country receive health insurance benefits from their employers, meaning many rely on publicly funded resources for health care. But that\u2019s not so simple in Texas: These types of health centers in the state meet only 10 percent of the need, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nTexas is also one of the worst states for reproductive health. In 2011, for example, the state cut its family planning budget by two-thirds, which led to an increase in teen abortions and births. That same year, it also rejected federal funding for a Medicaid women\u2019s health program, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nWomen\u2019s health care became a huge concern for Erin Smith, owner of Feges BBQ in Houston. Her outrage grew when Donald Trump became president. \u201cAt each step in the political process over the past two years, everything\u2019s so uncertain, and we need to take a stand and let people know the threat women are facing in health care, especially in Texas,\u201d Smith told HuffPost.\n\nIn 2017, the chef helped form I\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having, an organization fronted by chefs, bartenders and servers that\u2019s raising money and awareness to combat the assault on women\u2019s health care in Texas. The group\u2019s footprint is small, but it offers resources to women in an area where the need is great.\n\nIHWSH has helped its nearly 200 members, all of whom are women in the restaurant industry, access free gynecological exams. \u201c[Exams] are typically not covered under insurance,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201ca lot of the women are not provided insurance through employment, and most don\u2019t have insurance on their own.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the group raised and donated more than $210,000 to local organizations that prioritize women\u2019s health, including Planned Parenthood and The Rose, which provides breast cancer detection and treatment services to reduce deaths by the disease.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we become sexually active, we have very few healthcare paths as women. We are either actively preventing pregnancy, not actively preventing pregnancy, actively trying to conceive, or pregnant,\u201d Smith wrote in an essay for Food and Wine. \u201cBecause of this reality, more women are driven away from fields that do not provide easier and more affordable access to healthcare and other valuable resources.\u201d\n\nSmith gained a new level of understanding for her cause in 2018, when she learned she was pregnant. She\u2019s fortunate to be the owner of her restaurant, she said, because it allowed her to come up with a viable maternity leave plan for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very healthy pregnancy, but that\u2019s not the norm for everybody,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf there\u2019d been something that went wrong where the doctor put me on bedrest, I really don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month,\u201d she told HuffPost in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to the doctor all the time now. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something a lot of restaurants are able and willing to accommodate. The restaurant industry in general is made up of mom-and-pop small businesses. You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families.

See the other entries here between now and the new year.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Jim Knaver and his wife, Anna Hastings (known as Toni), spotted a little smoke in the air from their home in Paradise, California. They knew the risks of fire and had diligently cleared any flammable debris from their property. Jim checked the news for fire danger, he later told NPR, then drove to teach his fourth-grade class. Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate. Later that morning, the Camp Fire roared through Paradise at unprecedented speed. Without transportation or even the means to flee on foot, Toni couldn\u2019t get out. Jim lost touch over the phone around 11 a.m. Five days later, search teams confirmed they had found Toni\u2019s remains.\n\nWe live in an era of flood and fire. That disasters like the Camp Fire and the devastating hurricanes that have struck the U.S. in recent years are more frequent and more severe because of human-caused climate change is an indisputable scientific fact. Unless something changes, as the waters rise and the air grows thick with smoke, as medicines run out and food systems collapse, as higher, wetter, or more fertile ground becomes the only resource that matters, millions of people like Toni \u2015 millions of poor and non-wealthy, elderly, people with disabilities \u2015 are going to die.\n\nThere has never been a threat to humanity quite like catastrophic climate change. First, while most great disasters spring upon us quickly, we\u2019ve known the threat has been coming for almost 200 years. Second, we now have the technology to ameliorate the worst of the consequences, which is again unprecedented in human history. We couldn\u2019t have stopped the Black Death, for example, but the decarbonization of society is possible. Instead, year after year, things get worse, and we still do nothing. Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history. The green technology thus far deployed will have no more effect than pouring a thimbleful of water on a raging blaze.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen the worst happens, disabled people will die first. The problems extend far beyond wheelchair users who cannot physically evacuate through inaccessible areas. For example, I am mentally disabled. Without access to psychiatric medication, I wonder whether I could stave off suicidal ideation in the face of local climate collapse. Think about all the people who require insulin, chemotherapy, specialized nourishment pumped into their stomach, or people who can\u2019t access a shelter because it has no ramp or because crowds make them panic. The threats extend across categories.\n\nIn November, Alice Wong, a Bay Area resident and global disability justice leader, wrote about receiving air quality alerts as smoke from the fires more than 160 miles away made it dangerous to go outside. She knew she was privileged to stay home with her air purifier but rightly worried for those with lung-related conditions who lacked homes, access to masks, or other medical support.\n\nMarcie Roth, former FEMA official and currently CEO of the National Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, tells me there\u2019s been a \u201cfailure to plan. And a failure to meet the equal access requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate change adaptation folks are not really talking to the disaster risk reduction folks who are not really talking to the humanitarian relief folks who are not really talking to the CRPD [U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] folks who are not really talking to the strategic development/plan folks,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much siloing going on.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Roth argued that lack of planning for inclusive disaster relief puts everyone at risk, writing, \u201cA resilient community will plan for \u2013 and with \u2013 all of its members.\u201d\n\nWe can fix this. Not only can we focus our disaster responses on the most vulnerable people, but we can elect representatives who are willing to say the word, \u201cdecarbonization.\u201d As the 2020 Democratic Primary begins (it\u2019s already begun), who will be brave enough to speak up for those already being killed by climate change?

The manufacturers of amber teething necklaces claim that a baby\u2019s body temperature warms the amber, releasing a pain-relieving chemical that can be absorbed through their skin to relieve teething pain.\n\nAnd indeed, that chemical, called succinate or succinic acid, has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits. But the FDA has not tested the necklace manufacturers\u2019 claims for safety or effectiveness.\n\nPetardj via Getty Images Teething rings can pose a severe hazard, according to the FDA.\n\nDr. Jaime Friedman, a San Diego-based pediatrician, praised the FDA for issuing the warning. Friedman says that parents rarely ask for her advice on these teething necklaces before they buy one for their baby, but she frequently sees patients wearing them during appointments.\n\nFriedman makes it a point to counsel caregivers away from using them by bringing up choking and strangulation risks, as well as the unknown effects about the amber itself.\n\n\u201cI have not, as of yet, seen that there\u2019s any evidence of [succinic] acid in the bloodstream,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you do have this acid in the bloodstream, do we know what it\u2019s doing? No, I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\n\nFriedman, who is an official spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and affiliated with Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group, said that if parents insist on using the necklaces, she advises them to not let babies wear them unsupervised. That means no jewelry while they sleep, or while sitting in a car seat if an adult can\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s unsolicited advice, but hey, that\u2019s my job right? To protect kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has taken a strong stance against other at-home teething pain remedies, including numbing gels or creams for gums, as well as homeopathic teething tablets that were found to contain belladonna, a poisonous plant that can be dangerous to people.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caregivers give their babies a teething ring that has been chilled in the fridge to numb the pain. However, it warns against freezing teething rings, as frozen rings can damage gums. Another safe option for caregivers would be for them to use a clean finger to gently rub or massage their baby\u2019s gums."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump, Angry Over Mattis\u2019s Rebuke, Removes Him 2 Months Early", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/politics/trump-mattis.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two hours after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis went to the White House on Thursday to hand a resignation letter to President Trump, the president stood in the Oval Office and dictated a glowing tweet announcing that Mr. Mattis was retiring \u201cwith distinction\u201d at the end of February.\n\nBut Mr. Trump had not read the letter.

But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.\n\nMr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.\n\nMr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations \u2014 the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system. The statement added that Mr. Mnuchin would convene a meeting of the President\u2019s Working Group on financial markets, which he leads, to coordinate efforts to \u201cassure normal market operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s unanimous decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday reflected the confidence of its officials that the economy remains strong \u2014 even as they insisted that future rate increases would depend on continued growth. By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed\u2019s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.\n\nMany investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.\n\nBut even investors who disagreed with Wednesday\u2019s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.\n\nIn fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank\u2019s chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be \u201cashamed\u201d for keeping interest rates low \u2014 a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "A Shutdown for Weeks?

But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.\n\nTsunamis are created when large amounts of water \u2014 in the ocean, a bay or even a lake \u2014 are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.\n\nThis was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 225,000 people.\n\nMany other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.\n\n[See images from Indonesia after the latest tsunami to strike the country.]\n\nVolcanic activity creates a tsunami differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through. Either way, part of the volcano \u2014 perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater \u2014 can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.\n\nAnother possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.\n\nVolcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.\n\nPerhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island has built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)\n\nLandslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.\n\nA United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Far From Washington, the Routine Symbiosis of the Border Plays Out in Texas and Mexico", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/border-shutdown-wall-trump.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "HIDALGO, Tex. \u2014 A man crossing the bridge from Reynosa, Mexico, to Texas lugged a merry toddler-size Santa Claus pi\u00f1ata that he had bought for $10.

Often he erupts. \u201cFreaking idiots!\u201d he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than \u201cfreaking.\u201d\n\nFor two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him.\n\nNow, the president who once declared that \u201cI alone can fix\u201d the system increasingly stands alone in a system that seems as broken as ever. The swirl of recent days \u2014 a government shutdown, spiraling scandals, tumbling stock markets, abrupt troop withdrawals and the resignation of his alienated defense secretary \u2014 has left the impression of a presidency at risk of spinning out of control.\n\n[2018 in Review: The Highs and Lows of Trump\u2019s Year]\n\nAt the midpoint of his term, Mr. Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else\u2019s than at any point since taking office. He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely. As he sheds advisers at a head-spinning rate, he reaches out to old associates, complaining that few of the people around him were there at the beginning."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "A Shutdown for Weeks?

He canceled a holiday vacation to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and on Saturday convened a handful of the archconservative lawmakers who had pushed him into the shutdown for a private lunch in the White House residence.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to yield,\u201d Mr. Meadows, who attended the lunch, said in an interview. \u201cAt some point he in some way is going to get money to support our border. He is resolved in that, and I looked him in the eyes yesterday, and I can tell you that he is firm.\u201d\n\nBut by Sunday, increasingly isolated inside the White House with no public schedule, Mr. Trump had outwardly moved on to other issues. On Twitter, he announced the expedited departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said he had spoken with the Turkish president about Syria, expressed condolences to tsunami victims in Indonesia, said the news media had not given him his due for criminal justice and farm legislation, and mocked Mr. Corker.\n\nMr. Trump, who calls himself a master dealmaker, has made no effort to directly negotiate with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, who would have to agree to any wall funding. Instead, he has left the job to aides, dispatching one of them, Mick Mulvaney, the budget director and incoming chief of staff, to appear on television on Sunday morning to tamp down expectations that a deal could be coming anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Stock Market Rout Has Trump Fixated on Fed Chair Powell", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/politics/fed-chairman-trump-jerome-powell.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Mnuchin has worked in recent days to obtain Mr. Trump\u2019s assurance that he would not remove Mr. Powell, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that person cautioned that Mr. Trump could change his mind. The person noted Mr. Trump has a tendency to nurse grudges even when he temporarily sets a subject aside.\n\nMr. Mnuchin has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to stabilize markets, which are on pace for the largest December declines since the 1930s. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.\n\nMr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations \u2014 the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system. The statement added that Mr. Mnuchin would convene a meeting of the President\u2019s Working Group on financial markets, which he leads, to coordinate efforts to \u201cassure normal market operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s unanimous decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday reflected the confidence of its officials that the economy remains strong \u2014 even as they insisted that future rate increases would depend on continued growth. By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed\u2019s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.\n\nMany investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.\n\nBut even investors who disagreed with Wednesday\u2019s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.\n\nIn fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank\u2019s chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be \u201cashamed\u201d for keeping interest rates low \u2014 a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The New Old Age: This Type of Illiteracy Could Hurt You", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/health/health-literacy-seniors.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Yet health literacy can be particularly crucial for seniors.
