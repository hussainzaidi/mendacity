A majority, 55%, said they would vote for someone else.\n\nThat's in line with previous Fox News polls, which also found that a majority of voters wanted someone else to be president.\n\nThe findings of Fox News are no surprise. The President has consistently had a negative net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating). The re-election question is merely an offshoot of that and indicates that voters are not very happy with Trump's job performance so far.\n\nDespite the consistency of the negative polling results for Trump, I would be at least a little hesitant to read too much into them. Job growth from this point forward in his presidency is likely to be a more telling indicator.\n\nThe re-elect question (or some form of it) at this point in a president's first term has been almost laughably unpredictive of the actual election result. Americans said they wanted their president re-elected at this point in the 1980 and 1992 cycles. Both times the president would go on to lose. At this point in the 1984, 1996 and 2012 cycles, Americans said didn't want to re-elect the president. The president would go on to win.\n\nJust once out of six times (in the 2004 cycle) since 1980 did the re-elect question prove to be predictive two years out.\n\nThat means Trump has time to turn around his sinking ship. In fact, it could be simpler for him to do so than we think.\n\nAll the President may need is for the economy to keep up its growth.\n\nPresidential elections, though, are a totally different beast from midterm elections in terms of how the state of the economy affects them.\n\nLet's examine the relationship between a president's re-election margin and job growth from this point (December two years before the election) forward to said election for each of the 10 presidents who have run for re-election since World War II. (Note: I'm excluding 1964 because President John F. Kennedy was assassinated later in his first term.)\n\nIt turns out there has been a clear correlation between said job growth and the ultimate election result.\n\nIf the economy has the same job growth over the final two years of Trump's first term as it has over the first two years (about 3%), history suggests Trump would be favored to win by a few points.\n\nRemember, though, we're dealing with only 10 data points. Past trends may not hold. Moreover, the margin of error is wide enough that a Trump loss would be consistent with past data, even if job growth stayed steady. Part of Trump's chances will have to do with whether job growth is stronger in 2019 or 2020. Job growth closest to the election is more important (see 1980 for an example of this phenomenon).\n\nWith all those caveats, a maintenance of current levels of job growth in Trump's final two years could be enough to win him re-election.\n\nI should point out that in addition to the final two years of job growth I tried to take into account a president's approval rating at this point in a term and job growth up to this point. The idea being that maybe it's important to consider that Trump is currently unpopular even with strong job growth. The only thing that clearly mattered in forecasting a president's re-election margin was the final two years of job growth.\n\nPut another way, it's plausible that a continuing strong economy could boost Trump just in time to win, even though it hasn't helped him so far.\n\nOf course if the economy goes south, it could be the nail in Trump's re-election coffin."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Biden tops the 2020 field", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/01w0t5CSp_A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the pole position in the first CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll among likely 2020 Democratic caucusgoers, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke joining him as the only possible candidates in the field with double-digit support.\n\nThe new Iowa Poll finds 32% of likely caucusgoers saying they back Biden as their first choice, 19% Sanders, 11% O'Rourke, 8% Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 5% California Sen. Kamala Harris, with the rest of the 20-person field testing below 5% support.\n\nThe top three candidates in Iowa, including O'Rourke's third-place ranking, match the top three in a national CNN poll released Friday . Early results nationally are often driven by name recognition, but in Iowa, the campaign is already underway, with several of the tested candidates having made multiple visits to the state, and at least one having already visited all 99 of the state's counties.\n\nIowa's caucusgoers, who get the first formal say in who the party's nominee will be, mostly say they are looking for a winner (54% want a candidate who can defeat Trump) over ideological purity (40% want one who shares their positions on major issues). Those who prioritize a winning candidate are more apt to back Biden and O'Rourke than the overall pool of likely caucusgoers (36% in that group say they favor Biden, 14% Sanders, 14% O'Rourke) while Sanders outperforms his overall number among those looking for a candidate who shares their issue positions (30% Biden, 26% Sanders, 8% O'Rourke).\n\nOverall, more say that nominating a seasoned political hand (49%) would be a better way for the Democrats to try to to defeat Trump than to nominate a newcomer to politics (36%), and the bevy of senators (plus one congressman) atop the field may reflect that preference. The political newcomers tested -- businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang -- both failed to register much support in the poll.\n\nMost of Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers say they'd prefer to see a field with a number of strong contenders (52%) rather than a race dominated by one strong candidate emerging early as a clear frontrunner (41%), and the poll's findings suggest they are open to considering a large number of candidates. That's a contrast with the mood of Democrats nationwide, a majority of whom, after a bruising 2016 nomination battle that lasted through the entire primary season, say they are hopeful for the quick ascension of a frontrunner, according to CNN's poll.\n\nBeyond the horse race question, the Iowa survey asked likely caucusgoers if they could ever consider each of the candidates tested in the poll who they did not choose as their first- or second-choice candidate, or if they would never support that person. Nearly half (46%) of likely caucusgoers said there wasn't a single candidate in the field they would never support. Another 12% said there was only one candidate they would rule out.\n\nAnd many of those tested in the survey remain unknown, even to Iowa's politically active caucusgoers. Majorities said they could not offer an opinion on 12 of the 20 potential candidates when asked a basic favorability rating.\n\nOf the better-known candidates in the field, four merited favorable views from a majority of likely caucusgoers -- Biden (82% favorable), Sanders (74%), Warren (64%) and O'Rourke (53%). Booker and Harris weren't far behind with 49% rating each of them favorably, and former Attorney General Eric Holder also topped 40% favorability, landing at 42% in the poll.\n\nAlthough Holder doesn't register much support as a first or a second choice -- just 1% say they would put him in their top two right now -- 50% say they would ever consider backing him for president, a higher number than just about anyone else who ranked that far down the first-choice scale. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also comes close with 48% saying they'd consider her, though her favorability rating is a bit lower at 35%.\n\nWhat Iowa Democrats seem certain about is that they don't want to see another run from Hillary Clinton. Almost three-quarters say that if she were to get in the race she would detract from it (72% say so), and her favorability rating is narrowly upside down, with 49% holding an unfavorable opinion vs. 47% who have a positive view.\n\nTwo others who have flirted with presidential runs are also seen as more apt to detract from the race than to add to it: Oprah Winfrey (55% say she would do more to detract than add) and Howard Schultz (55% detract). Views on Michelle Obama, however, tilt sharply in the opposite direction. Three-quarters say she would add to the race for president should she throw her hat in the ring (76%), while just 22% say she would detract from it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Lawmaker open to 2020 ticket with Biden", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Rmae3zxaOGA/eric-swalwell-joe-biden-2020-sot-tsr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Rep.

An energized base of supporters in cities and suburbs, a more diverse freshman class in Congress to mix up the agenda, interesting likely candidates for President, and a shared focus on defeating President Donald Trump.\n\nIt is easy to see why, in the age of Trump, the debate about who should be the next nominee is primarily about who can beat Trump.\n\nThe questions many are asking go something like this: Does the nominee need to be a white man to reach voters the Democrats lost in states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania in 2016? Does the nominee need to be a woman or an African-American to energize key parts of the Democratic base who turned out in record numbers in the 2018 midterms?\n\nWhat kind of candidate, on paper, can bring an end to Donald Trump in the White House?\n\nBut these are the wrong questions. And they reflect the approach that has led the Democratic Party to nominate losing candidates. The belief that Trump has changed everything, while understandable, is a misconception.\n\nInstead of asking what kind of candidate can win, the question should be: What makes a good President?\n\nWhat are the qualifications or, more critically, the qualities we should look for in a nominee? And who has them? The fundamentals of these qualities have not changed, but the way we understand them and the public hopes and expects to see them has changed.\n\nFinding the right Democrat to run is not about out-Trumping Trump. Democrats can't and shouldn't compete with the anger and the divisiveness that have run through the veins of the Trump campaign and presidency.\n\nIf Democrats are going to win in 2020, they need to go back to basics and look for the person with the intangible qualities needed to serve as an effective President. They need to find the optimistic antidote to Trump's divisive, destructive style of governing.\n\nIt sounds simple, and perhaps quaint these days, but one of the most important qualities we need in a President is honesty . Not the \"aww shucks\" kind, but the kind where our President is not afraid to tell the American people what is happening in our economy and in our global engagements, not afraid to share views that aren't politically popular, and not afraid to admit mistakes.\n\nWe saw this quality in Congressman Beto O'Rourke when he gave a candid answer at a town hall meeting on the NFL controversy about kneeling during the National Anthem. He didn't offer poll-tested language; he spoke from the heart about what he actually believed. His honesty is one reason he has quickly emerged as a Democratic frontrunner, although he narrowly lost his Senate race in Texas. He is authentic and inspiring and says what he thinks. And more than anything, that is what inspires people to follow a leader.\n\nAn underrated but essential quality in a President Is empathy . It may seem foreign in this current environment, but an effective President feels the struggles and challenges facing the American public and then does something about them.\n\nWe have seen this quality in former Vice President Joe Biden time and time again. After experiencing unimaginable tragedy , with the loss of his wife and infant daughter and later his son, he turned his grief into an incredible capacity to comfort others -- a quality that is called upon often for Presidents after a school shooting, a hurricane or any unpredictable moment when the country looks to the Commander in Chief.\n\nSen. Cory Booker has this quality, as well. He may have gone too far in his self-promotional pronouncements at the Senate confirmation hearings on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but his time as Mayor of Newark led him to be a fierce and vocal advocate for criminal justice reform , long before it was an issue with real bipartisan potential.\n\nAnd there may be a healthy debate within the party about the impact of trade, but Sen. Sherrod's Brown's passionate defense of Ohio workers speaks to his empathy as well, and to the years he has spent in office representing towns where the closing of a factory has been devastating.\n\nThe job of running the United States requires not just a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the world as it has been, but also a curiosity about where the world is going and a willingness to take a fresh approach to the challenges we are facing as a country.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren had a serious fumble over the release of her DNA. But years ago, she also had the bold idea for addressing consumer woes long before Bernie Sanders ever ran for President.\n\nWarren was still a Harvard Law School professor when she came up with the idea for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She pushed forward an idea that eventually became not just law, but an entirely new federal agency dedicated to defending consumers. That was before she ever was in public office.\n\nRunning for President is tough, but being President requires a superhuman level of tenacity . There is a number of potential candidates, mostly women, who have shown they have the guts.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Kavanaugh would not have been as pointed and tough without the dogged questioning of Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar . Neither gave an inch beneath the stares of the all-male and all-white Republican side. They asked smart, incisive questions and in Klobuchar's case, and stood firm in the face of aggressive personal questioning from the nominee.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gillibrand says she's considering 2020 run Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gillibrand says she's considering 2020 run 00:39\n\ncourage . Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand got her start in electoral office by running for the US House of Representatives against a popular longtime incumbent in a district in New York that had not gone for a Democrat in decades. She pushed her way to the top of the pack without the initial help of the national party and not only won the seat, but quickly emerged as a rising star. After being named to the Senate to fill Hillary Clinton's seat when Clinton became Secretary of State, she later won the seat in a special election -- and soon took on the military to hold them accountable for dealing with rampant cases of sexual assault. All of that displays another essential quality for a President --\n\nThese candidates, and many not mentioned, have strengths and flaws. While a long primary process is exhausting to everyone involved, it allows for candidates to rise and fall. And the prism through which we should judge each candidate in the 2020 presidential race is how they exhibit these core human qualities: honesty, empathy, curiosity, tenacity and courage.\n\nDemocrats have come too far to be stuck still in entrenched factions and the false perception that an African-American woman can't represent white men, or a white man can't represent African-American women. All wings of the party have more in common than they have differences, especially when compared with Trump.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe debate needs to move beyond all this, because picking a presidential candidate is just not about what is on paper, or which nominee looks the part. It is about who embodies those intangible qualities that not only make a good human being, but also a great leader."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "What's driving Britain's broken boys to crime?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/JJ0BfNz42GM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) After a long day at work, Tilisha Goupall returned to her London home, made dinner and switched on the TV, just like any other night. It was after 10.30 p.m. that she realized her 15-year-old brother, Jermaine, was more than an hour late home from the movies, so she sent him a message on Snapchat. He never read it.\n\nJust minutes later, a police officer and a friend of Jermaine's knocked at her door -- her little brother had been stabbed, they told her. They led Goupall to a spot just two streets away, where the 26-year-old saw blood seeping onto the pavement from a police tent. She pushed past onlookers to talk to the authorities, only to be told Jermaine was dead.\n\n\"I just collapsed and cried -- the trauma from that moment made everything black,\" Goupall told CNN at her home, in the south London borough of Croydon.\n\nGoupall points out the route by which her brother fled from the gang, two streets from their family's home.\n\nIt's a scene that's become all too familiar in London, where knife crime is soaring, mostly among young men and boys, some of them incredibly young.\n\nAmong just two of the many recent incidents: a 14-year-old boy was left in a critical condition after being stabbed in the stomach by an 11-year-old in July, according to reports . And in the east London borough of Newham, two boys, aged 16 and 13, were convicted of grievous bodily harm for stabbing another 13-year-old boy in September.\n\nFrom June 2017 to June 2018, the latest period for which figures exist, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) recorded nearly 40,000 knife or sharp instrument crime offenses. This was the highest in the eight years for which data is available, and a 12% increase over 12 months. Despite the rise, these specific crimes are relatively rare, when compared to the frequency of other violent attacks, according to the ONS.\n\nAnd in February this year, London's monthly homicide rate briefly overtook New York's for the first time in history. The ONS report says homicides in London rose 14% in the 12 months to June 2018. This year alone, the UK capital has seen 131 murders, police say.\n\nJermaine Goupall was stabbed near this shop where other boys, who were being chased by the gang, had taken shelter.\n\nJermaine's death, in August last year, was a horrible case of mistaken identity, Goupall said, a view that has been backed by police . Before his death, rival gangs had been wielding knives and threatening to kill each other in drill music videos posted on YouTube, which have since been taken down. The gang members who killed Jermaine thought he was from a rival gang, according to Goupall.\n\nThe gang members, masked and armed with knives, approached Jermaine and some friends in a car. His friends managed to hide, but Jermaine tried to run home and was stabbed in the right thigh, an injury from which he died, Goupall said.\n\nIn February, three young men, aged 17 to 21, were found guilty of murder , while an 18-year-old woman was also convicted for manslaughter over Jermaine's death.\n\nOne of the rooms in the Goupalls' home, where Tilisha still lives with her father, has been transformed into a memorial with flowers, candles and photographs of Jermaine.\n\nGoupall is seen through the window of her family's front room in Thornton Heath, south London. The room has become a shrine dedicated to honoring the life of her brother, Jermaine.\n\n\"I miss everything about him. He was a very loving, funny and happy person,\" she said, looking at the photographs of her brother.\n\n\"It's hard to look at pictures, but I know what they meant when they were taken. When I watch a video and see him laugh, I cry, thinking, 'That's Jermaine -- that's my brother.'\"\n\nA lack of opportunity\n\nData from the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime shows knife offenses in London are predominately male-on-male crimes. In 2017, 90% of knife crime offenders were male. Of those crimes that actually caused injury, 78% of victims were male. Of all knife crimes, half were carried out by people under the age of 25.\n\nThe report says half of victims and half the offenders in London were from an ethnic minority background.\n\nAnd according to a report by the UK Parliament , 21% of 21,044 cases of knife possession across the country involved children between the ages of 10 to 17.\n\nAt a time when gender roles are rapidly evolving, women and girls have been able to cling onto movements that celebrate that change. Campaigns like #MeToo, for example, have been powerful vehicles for women and girls to challenge gender norms and explore what it means to be female.\n\nBut boys and men have not organized in the same way, observes comedian Michael Ian Black, a regular commentator on gender.\n\n\"No commensurate movement has emerged to help them navigate toward a full expression of their gender. It's no longer enough to 'be a man' -- we no longer even know what that means,\" Black wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed \"The boys are not all right.\"\n\nArguing that \"America's boys are broken,\" he wrote that gun violence in the US is more to do with boys being left behind than a lack of gun control.\n\nThe same could be said about the United Kingdom's broken boys, only here, knives are much easier to acquire than guns.\n\nOne problem is that boys with special needs are sinking in the country's public education system. Years of austerity that has significantly cut funds to youth services hasn't helped either.\n\nA joint study published this year by the UK's Ministry of Justice and Department of Education found that 40% of 10 to 18 year olds who'd carried out knife possession offenses had special educational needs during the 2012/13 academic year. Some 83% were persistently absent from school in at least one of the five academic years from 2008/09 to 2012/13 and, of that number, 21% had been permanently excluded.\n\nAn investigation by the UK's Times found that nearly 9,000 academically troubled pupils were intentionally excluded from school in the last three years and put into pupil referral units -- specialist schools for troubled students -- months before nationwide exams to boost schools' pass rates.\n\nBoys in these units are a prime target for gangs to recruit, according to Kieran Mitton from King's College London, who is researching masculinity and gangs in London.\n\n\"They get them when they're young at an age when they're easily impressed by a small amount of money or seeing weapons,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a lot easier for drugs to be carried by children because if they are caught they can't do the same kind of jail time than if they were over a certain age.\"\n\nMitton, who has studied gangs in several countries, said troubled boys and young men without fathers in their lives are at particular risk of committing crimes. Even in homes where fathers are present, if there is financial strain, a father may spend little time at home. Gang members can provide a \"sense of belonging or affection\" for a boy to fill the void.\n\n\"The boy craves self worth and respect and, by carrying out an act of violence for these men, they get a certain rating within the social pecking order for those guys.\"\n\n'We get bored so we end up doing stupid things'\n\nOn a YouTube youth educational show called \"Soapbox Real Talking Inspiration,\" host Paul McKenzie spoke to several teenage boys hanging out at a park in Enfield, north London, about gang life.\n\nOne 14-year-old boy, who is not identified, says he carries a 15-inch knife for \"safety.\"\n\n\"I don't want someone pulling up on me trying to kill me, so I'll kill him -- I don't want to die,\" he says.\n\nThe boy adds that he knows the damage his knife can do, but he doesn't care because, \"It's big and it'll get them scared.\"\n\nBut he acknowledges that in many ways boys causing trouble on the streets are bored. He complains there's often nothing to do, with no more youth clubs in the area.\n\n\"See, right now we've got holidays -- one week off school. They could do activities like play football or something,\" he said.\n\n\"But look at the park: no one is in here, it's just us -- we get bored so we end up doing stupid things for fun.\"\n\nResearch by the YMCA found that spending on youth services across the UK had decreased by \u00a3736 million ($939 million) between 2010 to 2017, with London taking 59% of cuts since 2010/11. And between 2011 to 2018, at least 800 youth workers had lost their full-time job, according to a paper by Sian Berry , co-leader of the UK Green Party.\n\nAusterity has also affected police numbers. Prime Minister Theresa May has faced criticism for cutting 20,000 police positions during her time as Home Secretary during the Cameron government. According to a parliamentary report, police numbers have declined 12.8% between 2010 and this year. The government says the cuts were necessary to help dig the UK out of debt.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan is also coming under pressure to do more about knife crime. Last year, Khan told CNN's Amanpour that London was the \"safest global city in the world,\" but he recently admitted to the BBC that solving knife crime could take \"a generation.\"\n\nCNN asked the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime why, despite pouring tens of millions of pounds into crime prevention, knife crime has risen. In a statement, the office responded by recognizing the crime rate was high but also blaming the UK government's cuts to police and youth services for the crisis.\n\nLearning to be a man\n\nRecognizing the impact a lack of youth centers has had on males and how they can be susceptible to crime, Manhood Academy holds regular workshops for boys aged 8 to 12. The boys learn how to communicate with each other and channel their feelings in a positive way to help them to become mature young men.\n\nManhood Academy boys chant the program's mantra, \"Boys are born! Men are made!\" at the beginning of a session in October.\n\nAt the academy in Haringey, north London, the chatter and giggles of young boys can be heard as they storm into the classroom, eager to start their session. In one exercise to teach the boys about resisting peer pressure, a boy is asked to stand in front of line as the others egg him on to step over it. Despite all the shouting, the young boy refuses, stamps his foot and says \"No!\"\n\nMany of the boys are raised by a single parent, some of them with one parent in prison. They are referred to the program by schools, parents or guardians who see them as at risk.\n\nBoys participating in the Manhood Academy program work in pairs to list things that they are good at doing.\n\nJermaine Freeman, 22, was mentored at the academy and is now himself a mentor. He says if it weren't for the academy, he would have ended up \"dead or in jail.\"\n\nGrowing up in Harlesden, northwest London, Freeman's mother died in 2016 of illness. He never had a relationship with his father. When he was a youth, he says a gang groomed him into selling drugs.\n\nJermaine Freeman was mentored at the Manhood Academy at the age of 17 before becoming a mentor himself.\n\nHe may still be young, but in the gang he quickly became an \"older\" -- someone a younger person looks up to -- to lure children into criminal activity. Freeman ran into trouble at school when he was caught with cocaine in his possession, which his own older expected him to sell to his peers.\n\n\"I was unhappy, unsatisfied and confused. I felt as though I had no choice but to join them,\" he told CNN. \"I looked up to these guys and they took advantage of my circumstances.

The bus traveled from the Antelope Wells port of entry in New Mexico to a Border Patrol station in Lordsburg, New Mexico, about 90 minutes away.\n\nCaal did not speak to the media Saturday, but in a statement issued by his lawyers, he said he was \"grateful for the many first responders that tried to save young Jakelin's life in New Mexico and Texas.\"\n\nStill, his lawyers called for an investigation that \"will assess this incident within nationally recognized standards for the arrest and custody of children. The family intends to assist in such an investigation into the cause and circumstances of Jakelin's death.\"\n\nThe lawyers, Enrique Moreno and Elena Esparza, also criticized border authorities for asking Caal to sign a form written in English about the state of his daughter's health not long after they arrived at the border, when she showed no problems.\n\nBut he speaks no English, the lawyers said.

Friday afternoon, a prayer service was held and Caal \"was able to spend time with her,\" he said.

The father and daughter traveled about a week before reaching the New Mexico border with a group of migrants the night of December 6 -- three days after her 7th birthday.\n\nNearly eight hours after they were detained, Jakelin and her father were loaded onto a bus bound for the Border Patrol station in Lordsburg, New Mexico, the CBP said.\n\nBefore leaving, her father told agents his daughter was sick and vomiting, the CBP said. An agent notified the station that the child would need emergency medical care.\n\nWhen the bus arrived at the Lordsburg station at about 6:30 a.m., the father told agents the child was not breathing, according to CBP.\n\nA Border Patrol EMT \"revived the child twice,\" the agency said. She had a temperature of 105.7 degrees. Local EMTs also provided care before she was transported at 7:45 a.m. by air ambulance to Providence Children's Hospital in El Paso.\n\nAt 11 a.m. on December 7, officials at the Lordsburg station were notified the girl had again been revived after going into cardiac arrest, the CBP said. A CT scan revealed brain swelling. She was breathing by machine and diagnosed with liver failure.\n\nJakelin died at 12:35 a.m. Saturday, the CBP said. Her father was there.\n\nThe medical examiner has not said why Jakelin died.\n\n\"The El Paso County Officer of the Medical Examiner's office -- which conducted Jakelin's autopsy -- has made no public statement regarding her cause of death,\" the lawyers said in their statement. \"In fact, neither the medical examiner nor Providence Children's Hospital have released records to Jakelin's father. We would ask that the media and federal agencies cease further speculation about her cause of death until these documents are released to Jakelin's family. Premature and inaccurate statements undermine the integrity of the investigation.\"\n\n'Their lives are beyond impossible'\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Garcia said Caal reiterated that his daughter was fed and given water throughout the journey.\n\n\"The father told us, 'My daughter was eating. My daughter was receiving liquids and she was fine,'\" Garcia said. \"He's been very clear and consistent that his daughter was healthy and wanted to come with him.\"\n\nGarcia said the father and daughter were not part of the well-publicized migrant caravan that traveled to the US border. They traveled by bus most of the way, he said.\n\nWhen asked what he'd say to people who criticize the father for endangering his child, Garcia said the family lived in extreme poverty.\n\n\"Their lives are beyond impossible.

Bernie Sanders and Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke joining him as the only possible candidates in the field with double-digit support.\n\nThe new Iowa Poll finds 32% of likely caucusgoers saying they back Biden as their first choice, 19% Sanders, 11% O'Rourke, 8% Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 5% California Sen. Kamala Harris, with the rest of the 20-person field testing below 5% support.\n\nThe top three candidates in Iowa, including O'Rourke's third-place ranking, match the top three in a national CNN poll released Friday . Early results nationally are often driven by name recognition, but in Iowa, the campaign is already underway, with several of the tested candidates having made multiple visits to the state, and at least one having already visited all 99 of the state's counties.\n\nIowa's caucusgoers, who get the first formal say in who the party's nominee will be, mostly say they are looking for a winner (54% want a candidate who can defeat Trump) over ideological purity (40% want one who shares their positions on major issues). Those who prioritize a winning candidate are more apt to back Biden and O'Rourke than the overall pool of likely caucusgoers (36% in that group say they favor Biden, 14% Sanders, 14% O'Rourke) while Sanders outperforms his overall number among those looking for a candidate who shares their issue positions (30% Biden, 26% Sanders, 8% O'Rourke).\n\nOverall, more say that nominating a seasoned political hand (49%) would be a better way for the Democrats to try to to defeat Trump than to nominate a newcomer to politics (36%), and the bevy of senators (plus one congressman) atop the field may reflect that preference. The political newcomers tested -- businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang -- both failed to register much support in the poll.\n\nMost of Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers say they'd prefer to see a field with a number of strong contenders (52%) rather than a race dominated by one strong candidate emerging early as a clear frontrunner (41%), and the poll's findings suggest they are open to considering a large number of candidates. That's a contrast with the mood of Democrats nationwide, a majority of whom, after a bruising 2016 nomination battle that lasted through the entire primary season, say they are hopeful for the quick ascension of a frontrunner, according to CNN's poll.\n\nBeyond the horse race question, the Iowa survey asked likely caucusgoers if they could ever consider each of the candidates tested in the poll who they did not choose as their first- or second-choice candidate, or if they would never support that person. Nearly half (46%) of likely caucusgoers said there wasn't a single candidate in the field they would never support. Another 12% said there was only one candidate they would rule out.\n\nAnd many of those tested in the survey remain unknown, even to Iowa's politically active caucusgoers. Majorities said they could not offer an opinion on 12 of the 20 potential candidates when asked a basic favorability rating.\n\nOf the better-known candidates in the field, four merited favorable views from a majority of likely caucusgoers -- Biden (82% favorable), Sanders (74%), Warren (64%) and O'Rourke (53%). Booker and Harris weren't far behind with 49% rating each of them favorably, and former Attorney General Eric Holder also topped 40% favorability, landing at 42% in the poll.\n\nAlthough Holder doesn't register much support as a first or a second choice -- just 1% say they would put him in their top two right now -- 50% say they would ever consider backing him for president, a higher number than just about anyone else who ranked that far down the first-choice scale.

Kirsten Gillibrand also comes close with 48% saying they'd consider her, though her favorability rating is a bit lower at 35%.\n\nWhat Iowa Democrats seem certain about is that they don't want to see another run from Hillary Clinton. Almost three-quarters say that if she were to get in the race she would detract from it (72% say so), and her favorability rating is narrowly upside down, with 49% holding an unfavorable opinion vs. 47% who have a positive view.\n\nTwo others who have flirted with presidential runs are also seen as more apt to detract from the race than to add to it: Oprah Winfrey (55% say she would do more to detract than add) and Howard Schultz (55% detract). Views on Michelle Obama, however, tilt sharply in the opposite direction. Three-quarters say she would add to the race for president should she throw her hat in the ring (76%), while just 22% say she would detract from it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "5 takeaways from the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MIlvtJlXqSg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) We have the first look at the state of play in Iowa in advance of the caucuses -- which will kick off the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in roughly a year's time.\n\nThe obvious lesson is that -- at this early stage -- being well-known is the key.

It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nEven the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nAnd most importantly for many folks, Obamacare prevents insurers from turning away or charging more to those with pre-existing conditions. This provision proved so popular that even Republican candidates found themselves promising to defend it in the recent midterm election in an unsuccessful bid to retain their majority in the House. Some 52 million people, or 27% of non-elderly adults, have a pre-existing condition that would have prevented them from getting coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\"You'd be hard pressed to find a part of the health care system that was not touched by the ACA,\" said Larry Levitt, the foundation's senior vice president, of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll this, however, could be swept away by a US District Court judge in Texas, who ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. It seeks to accomplish what Republicans have tried to do for years: repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe decision , which is expected to be appealed, doesn't immediately affect Americans' coverage. But if it's upheld by higher courts, it could turn back the clock on the nation's health care system to before Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, when the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 18.2%. It's now 10.3%.\n\nHere's what's at risk:\n\nMedicare\n\nObamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in the program.\n\nThe health reform law made many changes to Medicare. It slowed the growth of payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Medicare enrollees also receive free preventative benefits, such as screenings for breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nAnd Obamacare helped close the gap in Medicare's drug coverage and was on track to completely eliminate it by 2020. Senior citizens have to pay more for drugs while they are in the donut hole, which lies between the initial coverage and catastrophic coverage phases. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 accelerated the closing of the coverage gap to 2019.)\n\nBut Obamacare does mean higher costs for more affluent beneficiaries. The law froze the threshold for the Medicare premium surcharge at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples, so more people have become subject to it. The Affordable Care Act also added a premium surcharge on drug coverage for higher-income enrollees.\n\nEmployer-sponsored insurance\n\nObamacare requires that companies with at least 50 employees provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nThis mandate didn't have a major impact on the 150 million workers who are insured through their jobs. Most larger employers already offer coverage for full-time workers. However, setting the bar at 30 hours a week prompted some employers to extend coverage to more of their staff, since many companies had considered that threshold to be part-time.\n\nAlso, the law allows children to remain on their parents' plans until they turn 26. This has proven to be one of the more popular Obamacare provisions and has helped lower the uninsured rate of this age group.\n\nWorkers also no longer have to pay for contraceptives and preventative screenings, such as colonoscopies and mammograms. Obamacare requires these be provided free of charge.\n\nThe ACA also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending.\n\nObamacare also had an impact on employees who work at companies with fewer than 50 workers. Insurers can no longer ban workers with pre-existing conditions or ask them to pay more. The law requires plans to cover an array of benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. And it limits insurers from charging older workers premiums more than three times those of younger workers.\n\nHowever, this more comprehensive coverage has come at a price. Obamacare's regulations caused premiums to spike, forcing some small businesses to stop offering health insurance to their workers.\n\nIndividual market\n\nObamacare has had the largest impact on the individual market, which was largely unregulated prior to the health reform law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and banned them from charging the sick more. The law ended the practice of insurers imposing annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and it also placed limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. It mandates that insurers provide more comprehensive benefits, including medication, maternity and mental health. It prevents insurers from charging women more and restricts premiums for older folks to no more than three times those of young adults.\n\nObamacare set up health insurance exchanges to allow Americans to shop for individual policies and created federal subsidies so low- and moderate-income enrollees could buy policies for less than 10% of their income. It also limits the deductibles and co-payments for lower-income policyholders.\n\nNearly 11.8 million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. About 2.5 million Americans purchased individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. They cannot apply for subsidies, but receive all of the other benefits.\n\nMany consumers, however, have not been happy with the changes Obamacare wrought -- particularly because they caused premiums to spike. Many middle class Americans who don't qualify for subsidies have dropped their coverage, saying it's now unaffordable.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to undermine the law by providing alternative coverage -- such as short-term health policies -- that don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's provisions, particularly those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. It is also allowing states to apply for changes to their Obamacare programs. The main beneficiaries of these efforts are younger and healthier Americans, who will be able to buy less comprehensive policies with lower premiums.\n\nMedicaid\n\nBefore Obamacare, most Medicaid enrollees were low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the disabled and the elderly.\n\nThe health reform law opened up the program to low-income adults with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty threshold -- $16,700 for a single person -- in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. Nearly 12 million Americans gained coverage under this provision as of 2016, the most recent figures available.\n\nUnder the program, the federal government paid 100% of the costs of the expansion population for the first three years and is slowly lowering the reimbursement rate to 90%."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Federal judge in Texas strikes down Affordable Care Act", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/E11oovOsnRg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand.\n\nLegal experts say the ruling won't immediately affect Americans' health coverage, and a group of states led by California is already vowing to appeal. But the invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe ruling and expected appeal sets up another cliffhanger in which the fate of the law, which Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal for years, will likely once again ultimately lie with the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote leaving the law intact in 2012, but it's unclear how the justices will view this challenge, which centers on changes to the individual mandate that were baked into the 2017 tax reform.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to undo Obamacare, was thwarted in Congress last year by a lone vote from the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain.\n\nTrump immediately tweeted in celebration on Friday and called on Congress to act.\n\n\"As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe later added, \"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump told reporters that if the decision is eventually upheld by the Supreme Court, \"we will be sitting down with the Democrats\" to \"get great health care for our people.\"\n\n\"Let's say repeal and replace, handled a little bit differently, but it was a big, big victory by a highly respected judge,\" Trump said during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nLater Saturday, Obama took to Facebook to urge people to enroll in the program, writing in a post that Friday's ruling \"can be a scary thing to hear, particularly if you or someone you care about has a pre-existing condition.\"\n\n\"As this decision makes its way through the courts, which will take months, if not years, the law remains in place and will likely stay that way,\" he wrote.\n\nDemocratic House leader Nancy Pelosi decried the ruling and suggested that the coming Democratic-led House will intervene in the case.\n\n\"Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision and for the fear they have struck into millions of families across America who are now in danger of losing their health coverage,\" Pelosi said in a statement released late Friday. \"When House Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nToday, the law governs American health care.\n\nMore than 4 million people have already signed up for 2019 coverage on the exchanges, and millions more are expected to pick plans before open enrollment ends Saturday.\n\nThe ruling threatens to wipe away the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which became a focal point of the midterm elections and helped Democrats take the House.\n\nIn his opinion, District Judge Reed O'Connor said the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\"\n\nHe also held that the individual mandate is \"essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.\"\n\nThe case against the ACA was brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors, as well as two individuals. It revolves around Congress effectively eliminating the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe Republican coalition, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is arguing that the change rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional. The states say that the voiding of the penalty, which takes effect next year, removes the legal underpinning the Supreme Court relied upon when it upheld the law in 2012 under Congress' tax power.\n\nThe Trump administration said in June that it would not defend several important provisions of Obamacare in court. It agreed that zeroing out the penalty renders the individual mandate unconstitutional but argued that invalidates only the law's protections of those with pre-existing conditions. These include banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories, as well as limiting coverage of the treatment they need.\n\nBut the administration maintained those parts of the law were severable and the rest of the Affordable Care Act could remain in place.\n\nProfessor Tim Jost, of Washington and Lee University, noted that O'Connor went further than the Trump administration had asked.\n\n\"The Trump administration only asked that the individual mandate and provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions be invalidated, but O'Connor's order would invalidate many provisions of the Medicaid program, the Medicare program and other federal laws,\" he told CNN.\n\nBut Jost said the structure of the challenge and of O'Connor's ruling means that nothing will change right away.\n\n\"Judge O'Connor has declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act invalid, but he has not blocked its continued operation,\" Jost said.\n\nBecause the administration would not defend the law, California, joined by 16 other Democratic states, stepped in. They argued that the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, can stand without it. Also, they said that eliminating Obamacare or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of Americans.\n\nAppeal coming\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the ruling \"an assault\" and a spokesperson for his office indicated an appeal would be coming.\n\n\"Today's ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA's consumer protections for healthcare, on America's faithful progress toward affordable healthcare for all Americans,\" Becerra said in a statement. \"The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAmerican Medical Association president Barbara McAneny said the group will work with other groups in pursuing an appeal and reversal of the decision.\n\n\"Today's decision is an unfortunate step backward for our health system that is contrary to overwhelming public sentiment to preserve pre-existing condition protections and other policies that have extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,\" she said in a statement. \"It will destabilize health insurance coverage by rolling back federal policy to 2009. No one wants to go back to the days of 20 percent of the population uninsured and fewer patient protections, but this decision will move us in that direction.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paxton applauded the ruling and said it represents a massive check on federal power.\n\n\"Today's ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system while our multistate coalition lawsuit works its way through the courts,\" Paxton said in a staement. \"Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said he felt an appeal could be looked on favorably by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The ruling relies on conclusions about who can bring this suit and about the impact of President Trump's tax bill that have been widely debunked by scholars from across the political spectrum,\" Vladeck said. \"It will certainly generate headlines, and it may even be upheld by the conservative federal appeals court in Texas, but it's difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court\u2014which has already turned away two challenges to the ACA\u2014would agree with tonight's ruling.\"\n\nPre-existing conditions and the midterm fight\n\nThe lawsuit entered the spotlight during the midterm elections, helping propel many Democratic candidates to victory. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions became a central focus of the races. Some 58% of Americans said they trust Democrats more to continue the law's provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October.\n\nThe consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to Obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape. Their popularity is one of the main reasons GOP lawmakers had such difficulty repealing Obamacare last year.\n\n\"Guaranteed issue\" requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurers often rejected applicants who are or had been ill or offered them only limited coverage with high rates.\n\nUnder the law's community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person's health history. And the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder's medical background.\n\nAll these provisions meant millions of people with less-than-perfect health records could get comprehensive coverage. But they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. This group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies that offered fewer benefits prior to Obamacare. That has put the measures in the crosshairs of Republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums.\n\nIt's no wonder that politicians on both sides of the aisle promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions during the election. Three-quarters of Americans say that it is \"very important\" for the law to continue prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage because of medical histories, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's September tracking poll -- 58% of Republicans feel the same way. And about the same share of Americans say it's \"very important\" that insurers continue to be barred from charging sick people more."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Pelosi and the 5-week battle with Democratic rebels over the speaker's gavel", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/x2aSJQCOrj8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) As Rep. Nancy Pelosi took the stage in a noisy hotel ballroom in Washington on election night she was greeted with chants of \"Speaker! Speaker! Speaker!\"\n\nHer party had just won back the House of Representatives, and the longtime Democratic leader and first woman in history to hold the speaker's gavel was poised to do it again.\n\nBut many of the Democrats who made that victory possible had also made a big promise: They wouldn't support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nThose dynamics set the stage for an internal party dispute that would soon play out in the halls of Congress, as Pelosi flexed the muscle she'd built over years as a relentless negotiator to once again keep her caucus in line.\n\nLess than 24 hours after she gave her victory speech on election night, roughly a dozen incumbent Democrats joined a conference call to game out ways to bring change to party leadership for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThey would need a relatively small number of Democrats to prevent Pelosi from getting 218 votes come January, when the full House holds its speaker election. Given the small group of incumbents lining up to oppose her -- plus the incoming freshmen already in the anti-Pelosi column -- the group of detractors felt good about their numbers.\n\n\"I am 100% confident we can forge new leadership,\" Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas told CNN a week after the election.\n\nPublicly, Pelosi was unfazed by the opposition. She went on a media barnstorm around Election Day, repeating in interview after interview that she felt confident she would be speaker again, despite the math problem that lay before her.\n\n\"This is not a day at the beach, this is politics,\" Pelosi said in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo. In nearly the same breath, she, too, asserted she was \"100%\" confident she would win.\n\nThe next month would be a battle over who was right: the powerful, veteran lawmaker from California known for never backing down, or the small group of Democrats desperate for change at the top. They were ready to duke it out over the long haul, even if that meant an ugly floor fight on the first day of the new Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi was busy on another negotiating front trying to avert a partial government shutdown. On Tuesday, she sat down for the now-famous meeting with President Donald Trump and the Senate's top Democrat, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, in the Oval Office.\n\nThe public got a rare look at the Pelosi who Democrats have talked about for years -- the fearless, unyielding leader who's commanded respect from so many, even if in an intimidating way.\n\nPelosi's performance instantly went viral online, particularly when the President suggested she might be weakened in the negotiations because of her fight back at home for speaker.\n\n\"Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\" she shot back.\n\nWhile Trump and Democrats aren't close to a deal on a spending measure, Pelosi and her Democratic challengers were ready to wrap things up.\n\nExactly five weeks after that conference call among the so-called rebels, the two sides announced an agreement on Wednesday, each giving concessions that would all but guarantee Pelosi would become speaker -- but only for four more years, at most.\n\nThe transitional pitch\n\nIt was preordained that Pelosi would have a speaker fight. With Republicans spending tens of millions of dollars in the midterms to paint her as the villain, Democrats were asked in races across the country whether they would support her for the job.\n\nAccording to a CNN count leading up to the election, close to 30 Democratic incumbents and new candidates who had solid chances of winning in November were firmly on the record opposing Pelosi. While she enjoyed support from the vast majority of her caucus, it would take only a small number to thwart her speakership chances in January.\n\nIn October, Pelosi told the Los Angeles Times she would be a \"transitional\" speaker. It wasn't too surprising a statement -- Pelosi is 78 -- but it was one of her first serious nods that she wasn't planning to be in the top spot indefinitely.\n\n\"I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love,\" she said.\n\nAs to when she would be leaving Congress, Pelosi didn't budge. \"Do you think I would make myself a lame duck right here over this double espresso?\" she said in the LA Times interview. Over the next several weeks, Pelosi would continue to keep her timeline a mystery.\n\nWith no clear end in sight, the promise of a transition wasn't enough to ease the concerns of those wanting new leadership -- and wanting it soon. A week after the election, the group of rebels started collecting signatures on a letter vowing to oppose Pelosi for speaker, eventually releasing it with 16 names. They claimed others were also a \"no\" but declined to publicly sign the letter.\n\nThe lobbying effort of the anti-Pelosi freshmen also kicked into full gear. The detractors were in constant communication, educating them on the speaker vote process and reminding them it would be their first vote in Congress -- and would they really want to break a campaign promise on their first day in office?\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi supporters were furious at the idea that Democrats would deny a woman the speakership after record numbers of women won on Election Day. Pelosi helped raise $135 million for Democrats, and she was widely regarded as an effective leader, even by some of her critics. The most common complaint was she had simply been there too long and amassed too much power over the caucus.\n\nPelosi backers were also swarming the incoming freshmen with texts and phone calls, making it clear that Pelosi had most of the caucus behind her. Freshmen were told that a vote against Pelosi would be a vote for the Republicans, which wasn't entirely true, as a member can vote for anyone for speaker. But it was a talking point that took hold in November and would be repeated by members as they weighed their options.\n\nJUST WATCHED Internet lights up over Pelosi's sunglasses Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Internet lights up over Pelosi's sunglasses 02:03\n\nCan you beat someone with no one?\n\nAmid all the lobbying and public posturing, the detractors had one escalating problem: They couldn't find anyone to run against Pelosi.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who had challenged Pelosi two years ago for minority leader and won nearly a third of the caucus, toyed with the idea of another run but didn't step forward. Rising Democratic stars like Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Cheri Bustos of Illinois sought lower-level leadership positions. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, who've long been ranked No. 2 and No. 3 after Pelosi, would consider a speaker run only if there were a vacancy at the top.\n\nAs pressure mounted for a challenger to step forward, Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Ohio and part of the group of detractors, considered the idea shortly before Thanksgiving. But within just a few days -- and after a private sit-down with Pelosi -- Fudge announced she was not only holding back from a challenge but also that she would be supporting Pelosi. At nearly the same time, it was also announced Fudge would chair a subcommittee on voting rights, an issue she's passionate about.\n\nAnd that's how Pelosi would slowly start picking off incumbents -- one by one.\n\nSoon after Fudge, Rep. Brian Higgins of New York, one of the 16 Democrats who had signed the anti-Pelosi letter, announced he would support Pelosi after she gave him reassurances on two of his pet issues -- infrastructure and Medicare. Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, another signatory, also flipped after private conversations with Pelosi.\n\nHiggins said others who had signed the anti-Pelosi letter were looking for an \"out,\" and he urged them to press Pelosi for policy commitments in exchange for support (like he did).\n\n\"Life is about leverage,\" Higgins said.\n\nThe detractors saw Pelosi's powerful network in full force back at home. Protesters rattled Rep. Seth Moulton, one of the most vocal Pelosi critics, at one of his town halls in Massachusetts. Rep. Kathleen Rice, another outspoken critic, was getting calls from prominent donors and political figures in her home state of New York asking her to back down.\n\nPelosi supporters also fueled a successful social media campaign that became known as #fivewhiteguys , framing the anti-Pelosi faction as a group of white men -- even though it had multiple women and included a few members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nOne aide close to the rebels said the sexism campaign was unfair but effective and expressed regret that Fudge, a woman and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, didn't run, as her challenge would \"have at least tamped down the sexism cries.\"\n\n\"No one wants to be called sexist. It had nothing to do with that,\" the aide said. \"If it was Steny Hoyer at the top, it would be the same conversation about wanting new leadership.\"\n\nFlipping 32 Democrats\n\nSoon after Thanksgiving, the caucus held its internal leadership election on a secret ballot to nominate its candidate for speaker. Pelosi won overwhelmingly, losing only 32 votes out of a caucus of 235 voting members.\n\nFor Pelosi allies, flipping enough of those 32 Democrats seemed entirely doable. She still had plenty of leverage and plenty of time.\n\nBut the detractors maintained they still had the numbers on their side and, even with no challenger, could prevent her from getting to 218 on the floor.\n\nRyan, Moulton and Rice, on the same day as the caucus vote, had a meeting with Pelosi in her office. They requested that she leave before the end of her first term as the next speaker. The meeting went nowhere.\n\nMeanwhile, another leader in the small group, Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, had been privately negotiating with Pelosi. The two had a long-running relationship, as Perlmutter was not an outspoken member frequently in the headlines criticizing leadership.\n\nDespite some tension in the group over messaging and strategy, the Perlmutter talks soon became the clear avenue to any potential deal, and the Colorado lawmaker frequently kept the group up to speed on his conversations.\n\nOr as one Democratic aide put it: \"In any war, there's a role for soldiers and diplomats. You need soldiers to do fighting, and then you need diplomats to end the fighting. Rarely are those two roles filled by the same person.\"\n\nOver the coming weeks, Perlmutter and Pelosi would have roughly a dozen conversations behind the scenes, but it wasn't until December 4 that the two reached a turning point.\n\nIt was a quiet day on Capitol Hill. President George H.W. Bush was lying in state just down the hallway from Pelosi's office, and Washington was preparing for his funeral as story after story ran about Bush's kindness and decency.\n\nJUST WATCHED Fact check: Trump's heated Oval Office meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fact check: Trump's heated Oval Office meeting 04:59\n\nDuring a sit-down in her office with Perlmutter, Pelosi expressed openness to term limits for committee chairs and senior leadership. The moment became a game changer for the group of detractors.\n\nOver the next week, the conversation would narrow to focus solely on term limits for the party's top three leaders, which would affect Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn. The two men were aware of the negotiations but were not a part of them and were staunchly opposed to term limits.\n\nPerlmutter later reflected on tense conversations with the longtime leaders.\n\n\"This place is based on relationships and (when) you start changing those relationships, you can strain some things,\" he told reporters. \"Different folks have different views of all of this. That's just the nature of life, but it certainly applies here.\"\n\nAs word spread that term limits were now on the negotiating table, frustration grew among many in the caucus, especially among Congressional Black Caucus members, who have a history of opposing term limits.\n\n\"This whole thing about these guys needing something so that they can land this damn plane is getting silly,\" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"Land the plane. Vote for her. And let's please get on.\"\n\nA final deal\n\nPerlmutter then had a final sit-down with Pelosi. This time he was joined by Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, a member of leadership who made news last year when calling for a new generation of leaders, and Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois, another quiet leader among the so-called rebels.\n\nThe trio turned heads as they had to walk through a bustling holiday reception for reporters to enter Pelosi's office.\n\nIt was then that they locked in the deal. Pelosi would support a limit of three terms for senior leaders, with the option of running for a fourth and final term but only with approval from two-thirds of the caucus, rather than the traditional simple majority.\n\nThe deal would be retroactive. Since Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn had already served two terms as speaker, majority leader and majority whip when Democrats last held power, they would be entering their third terms in 2019 and could run for one more term at most.\n\nThe concession at first seemed striking, given how reluctant Pelosi had been to place any sort of timeline on her political future. The reality, though, is she was unlikely to stay for very long, anyway.\n\nIn return, she won over seven of her detractors, all but guaranteeing she would get the 218 votes on the floor -- yet still make it possible for some of the freshmen to uphold their campaign promises to vote against her on the floor.\n\nThe deal was not warmly received by Hoyer and Clyburn. The caucus still has to vote on the term limits for the rules to officially change, and it's unclear whether they'll be approved.\n\nPelosi has promised to abide by the term limits, anyway.\n\n\"I feel very comfortable about what they are proposing, and I feel very responsible to do that, whether it passes or not,\" she said at her weekly news conference Thursday.\n\nSome in the group notably didn't sign on to the deal. Rice, along with Reps. Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jim Cooper of Tennessee, were three signatories of the original letter who still maintain their opposition. For some, the deal didn't go far enough; Pelosi would still be holding the reins -- and possibly for another four years.\n\nBut many in the group felt they got what they were looking for: a timeline for a transition and a commitment to training more future leaders. \"These pieces put into place are going to create the churn,\" Sanchez said.\n\nCould Pelosi have gotten to 218 on her own, without striking the deal? \"She may have,\" Perlmutter conceded. \"People were going one at a time in some respects. And her skills are real, so that's possible.\"\n\nBut as a brutal, embarrassing floor fight on January 3 remained possible, the reticence was growing.\n\n\"There was a recognition ... is that how we wanted to start things?\" Perlmutter said. \"And the answer was at the end of the day: probably no.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Rape survivors are fighting back against victim-blaming in Lebanon", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ameEaCTRyaQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) \"I've been raped,\" Manal Issa shouts as she staggers down a street in Beirut.\n\nA crowd gathers around the woman who appears disoriented and frantic. Some people encourage her to \"calm down\" and \"keep it quiet.\" Others scold her for wearing a mini-skirt. One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file. Reham was repeatedly sexually assaulted by her older brother from the age of 8 to 28. When she finally spoke up, her mother called her a \"liar.\"\n\nSitting on a chair in a sparsely furnished room, actress Hiba Sleiman listens to Reham's recording through an ear piece, retelling the moment of confrontation between mother and daughter.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to tell you how she tore off my hijab, how she tore off my clothes and inspected me from head to toe while she beat me and insulted me repeatedly. When it was over, I said 'did you get what you wanted?' ... I carried my torn clothes and cried and screamed, and cried and screamed. And nobody heard me.\"\n\nHiba describes audiences going from room to room at Zico House, a cultural center in Beirut, listening to six actors tell survivors' stories as part of an immersive play, organized by #ShameOnWho.\n\n\"It was moving. It was intense. A lot of people cried. Some people couldn't watch all of the scenes. Some people walked out of specific scenes in the middle of them,\" says Hiba.\n\nFigures representing women killed by male relatives in Lebanon during a rally organized by the women's rights group KAFA this January.\n\n\"We don't have the space for telling these stories so often. We hear these stories on Facebook, or on TV but we never really encounter these people in our lives.\"\n\nBut Lebanon's civil society appears determined to give women a larger platform and counter social practices perceived as sexist.\n\nLast month, women's rights activists called for the boycott of the television channel MTV Lebanon after it aired an interview with Mohammed al-Nheily, the husband and convicted killer of 33-year-old Manal Assi, in a program on Lebanese prisoners called Out of Freedom. Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ... 'I'm going to send it to the whole society for them to see what a bad person you are,'\" the woman recalls.\n\nFor two months, the woman cried herself to sleep until she mustered the courage to confront her harasser.\n\n\"I told him 'you can show the video to whoever you want ... This is my body and I'm free to do whatever I want. I'm free to sleep with whoever I want,\" she says.\n\nShortly after that, she had the video deleted after one of her male friends took her harasser's phone away from him.\n\nWomen hold placards denouncing domestic violence during a rally on the \"International Women's Day\" on March 8, 2014 in front of the National Museum in the capital Beirut.\n\nThroughout her ordeal, she never resorted to the police or her family. \"They would have told me it was my fault for going to the hotel with him, for being so easy, for doing whatever I felt like doing,\" she says.\n\nStill unable to drop the veil of anonymity, she nevertheless calls on other women to \"face their fears.\"\n\n\"We should always know we are victims, we are not the ones who did wrong.

Since the 1930s , scientists have usled fetal tissue in the US, obtained through elective abortions in medical research and experimental therapies. And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not. Humanized mice, which possess human cells, DNA tissues or immune systems, are used in some biomedical research.\n\nAccording to the scientist whose humanized mouse research was debated between the two sides, some truth can be found on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhat's the issue with human fetal tissue?\n\nIn September, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled a contract with a fetal tissue procurement company due to concerns that the company was not meeting regulations. Subsequently, HHS initiated an audit of human fetal tissue acquisitions and a review to understand whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\n\nHowever, those opposed to abortion have sought, for decades, to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue, while those in the research world support its use.\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. The National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows.\n\nNot only has the federal government funded fetal tissue research for more than seven decades with procurement governed by an \"extensive regulatory framework,\" but fetal tissue research has a \"long history of support from both sides of the aisle,\" said Judy Chu, the Democratic representative from California who sits on the Steering and Policy Committee, during the hearing. Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Chain restaurants are less healthy than fast food, global study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/V6mZto7rmAY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Fast food often gets the blame for calorific meals, but new research has found that your favorite chain restaurants are dishing up meals with even more excessive calories, worsening the global obesity epidemic.\n\nOverly large portions and food laden with sugar and fats are regularly being served in sit-down eateries, as well as fast food outlets, according to two studies published in the BMJ on Wednesday.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the problem -- which experts say is fueling obesity, pushing up rates of diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses -- is also not confined to the United States, the studies say.\n\nAlthough the poor nutritional content of fast food has been well-documented, there has been less research into the energy content of more traditional \"full-service\" or sit-down restaurants.\n\nOne UK study analyzed the calories in 13,500 main meals served in 27 UK restaurant chains, of which 21 were full-service restaurants and the remainder serving fast food. A US study measured calories in the most frequently ordered meals in 116 restaurants across five countries -- Brazil, China, Finland, Ghana and India -- comparing them against the United States.\n\nThe calorie content of the most popular meals in British and international restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations, the researchers found. In the global study, only China was found to serve \"significantly less energy than restaurants in the US.\"\n\nFast food, it concluded, contained on average 33% fewer calories than more formal restaurant meals.\n\nThe UK's health agency, Public Health England, recommended that lunches and evening meals should not exceed 600 calories (also measured as kcal). But almost none of the restaurants surveyed reflected this.\n\n\"We found that the number of calories in the average restaurant meal was more than the number of calories in the average fast food meal,\" said Eric Robinson, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, who led the UK study. \"A lot of people would expect there to be more calories in fast food, but our findings were counter to that.\"\n\n'Fast food comes out as the good guy'\n\nThe average main meal dish at a fast food chain in the UK contained 751 calories, compared with an average of 1,033 at sit-down restaurants. Only 11% of full-service dishes served at the 21 restaurants studied -- including Pizza Express, Zizzi and Wagamama -- met the recommended limit of 600 calories, though that rose to 17% in fast food meals.\n\nThese restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe worst-performing of the British fast food outlets, KFC, had an average of 987 calories per meal, but it fared better than more than half of the sit-down restaurants. Meanwhile, an average meal at Burger King (711 calories) proved less calorific than every one of the traditional restaurants surveyed.\n\nThe worst offenders were named as Hungry Horse, where the average meal contained 1,358 calories, followed by Sizzling Pubs (1,269 calories) and Flaming Grill Pubs (1,232 calories).\n\nSizzling Pubs' parent company, Mitchells and Butlers, said in a statement, \"We share nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests make knowledgeable decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us.\n\n\"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.\"\n\nThe other restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe international study, which didn't name specific restaurants, found an average of 809 calories in main meal dishes served by fast food chains and 1,317 calories in restaurant chains. Only the Chinese served fewer calories than Americans: 1,045 calories in full-service, compared with 1,362 in US eateries, and 561 in fast food restaurants, as opposed to 969 in America. Indian meals tended to be higher in calories; restaurants in the remaining countries were comparable to those in the United States.\n\nOnce again, a small minority of meals met the 600-calorie recommendation, with 94% of full-service dishes and 72% of fast food dishes exceeding this limit.\n\nRobinson said that although there is considerable debate in Britain about forcing restaurants to display calorie content, only 9% of the meals his research covered met the maximum.\n\n\"So even if you want to know about calories on the menu, you are not left with many meals to choose from,\" he said. \"Restaurants need to serve fewer calories. There are a lot of meals that have far too many calories, whether it's due to portion sizes, ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n\"The bigger issue it relates to is that we are living in a food environment that encourages and causes people to eat more calories than they need,\" he said. \"If a government is serious about trying to reduce obesity and the number of people who die young because of poor diet and obesity, then the food environment is something that needs to be addressed and tackled.\"\n\nSusan Roberts, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, was the lead author of the international study. \"Until now, fast food has been criticized all the time, but in this study, fast food comes out as the good guy,\" she said. \"It was still bad, but it had 33% less calories than standard restaurants.\"\n\nPotential steps to be taken include reducing portion sizes or even introducing proportional prices for restaurant meals, Roberts said. In other words, people would be required to pay for the portions they ordered rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"I think that most of us would be delighted to be able to go into a restaurant and order the size that we actually want. But that would mean that restaurants would have to actually recognize that they are part of the problem, which I think they will deny,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe authors of both reports said no firm conclusions could be drawn, as both were observational. However, they also warned that their findings may not fully reflect the reality, as they did not take in to account drinks, appetizers, desserts or side orders.\n\n'Step up and take responsibility'\n\nCaroline Cerny, lead of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 British organizations and charities, noted that \"regularly eating excess calories over time leads to weight gain.\"\n\n\"Children these days are growing up in an obesogenic environment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to make healthy choices.

Maybe the troublemakers will enter the game like they did last week - but it can't be on the same scale, because today there simply aren't enough bona fide protesters around to give them cover.\n\nThe \"gilets jaunes\" who have turned out seem to be the hardline left-wing element. There is a lot of talk about the \"RIC\" - Citizens' Initiative Referendums. This is a demand of the far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon - and a long way from the yellow vests' original call, which was for a simple cut in fuel tax (long since conceded).\n\nThe movement - or at least the Saturday protest movement - is shrinking and hardening.\n\nBut has the government not made a U-turn?\n\nThe impact of the demonstrations has been keenly felt in France. The government has been forced to bow to pressure and adjust its economic course.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron responded to the nationwide street protests by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise, and promising an extra \u20ac100 (\u00a390; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.\n\nHowever, it is far from clear that he has done enough to defuse public anger.\n\nWhat is the yellow-vest movement?\n\nThe protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France.\n\nThey were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel.\n\nMr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments.\n\nBut protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements.\n\nThe movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, has widespread support.\n\nProtest timeline"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Ryan Zinke: US interior secretary to leave administration", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46580094", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:00:30", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nUS Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is leaving his post at the end of the year, President Donald Trump says, in the latest high profile departure from his administration.\n\nIn a tweet, President Trump thanked Mr Zinke for his service, saying he had \"achieved much during his tenure\".\n\nHe said he would appoint a new interior secretary next week.\n\nMr Zinke, an ex-Navy Seal and a former Montana congressman, has been embroiled in allegations of ethics violations.\n\nThey include a land deal in Montana involving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton, Politico reported.\n\nThe interior department oversees federal land, including national parks such as Yosemite and Yellowstone.\n\nMr Zinke has faced scrutiny over expensive trips in US Park Police helicopters and on private jets.\n\nCostly alterations at his department also came in for criticism, including reports that three sets of double doors in his office were being upgraded at a cost of nearly $139,000 (\u00a3110,000).

which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU.\n\nBut anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia.\n\nNationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa.\n\nHowever, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list.\n\nSo it is introducing the ETIAS - an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is \"way cheaper\".\n\nIt is not a visa but a travel requirement for anyone on that list of 61 non-EU countries who are coming to the EU for business, tourism, medical or transit-related reasons for up to 90 days.\n\nThe EU says the ETIAS system will \"to strengthen security checks on those persons who travel visa-free to the EU\".\n\nWhat will UK travellers to the EU have to do?\n\nUnder the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020.\n\nAfter this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return.\n\nBut although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal.\n\nThe form - which the EU describes as a \"necessary and small procedural step\" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says.\n\nThe details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption UK passports -

The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border.\n\nIt is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, but according to the EU and UK's political declaration, both sides will aim to provide \"visa-free travel for short-term visits\".\n\nThe European Commission previously said the EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was \"entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states\".\n\nThe proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force.\n\nThe UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months.

If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\n\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\n\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\n\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\n\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\n\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\n\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\n\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\n\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\n\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\n\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\n\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\n\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\n\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\n\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Katowice: COP24 Climate change deal to bring pact to life", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46582025", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Chairman Michal Kurtyka was in high spirits as the conference reached agreement\n\nNegotiators in Poland have finally secured agreement on a range of measures that will make the Paris climate pact operational in 2020.\n\nLast-minute rows over carbon markets threatened to derail the two-week summit - and delayed it by a day.\n\nDelegates believe the new rules will ensure that countries keep their promises to cut carbon.\n\nThe Katowice agreement aims to deliver the Paris goals of limiting global temperature rises to well below 2C.\n\n\"Putting together the Paris agreement work programme is a big responsibility,\" said the chairman of the talks, known as COP24, Michal Kurtyka.\n\n\"It has been a long road.

Looking back on all the things I have and haven\u2019t accomplished these past 12 months, I feel good about the progress I\u2019ve made toward many of my personal goals. But there\u2019s one particular thing I never quite seem to get around to, and I simply can\u2019t neglect it any longer. So this is it, I\u2019ve decided. This is the year I will, at long last, burn down your home.\n\nNo more excuses. I\u2019m going to do it this time. I\u2019m going to turn this house into a fiery inferno.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve sworn I would do it. I\u2019ve been putting it off and putting it off. I really meant to get it done last winter, but then I procrastinated and got distracted by other things. Not this time, though. This year I\u2019m torching this place to the ground, and I\u2019m taking everything you love with me.\n\nWith every day that passes, I grow more and more prepared to incinerate you and all your earthly possessions. At the moment, I\u2019m barely a foot away from the curtains and your sofa. I\u2019m plugged into an overloaded power strip with a lamp, a TV, an electric blanket, and God knows what else. Sure, I have a \u201cfail-safe\u201d that\u2019s supposed to shut me off if I tip over, but you\u2019ve often got me up on an end table, and who knows what might happen if I fall face down on your carpet from that height?\n\nI am so ready to do this shit.\n\nLooking back, I see I\u2019ve let too many good opportunities slip by: All those nights you\u2019ve forgotten to turn me off before going to bed. The time you let a throw pillow fall right on my grill and didn\u2019t notice for hours. That winter your furnace went out and you ran me on high, 24/7, until my plug melted a little and I came oh-so-close to causing an electrical fire. But each year, before I know it, spring rolls around and I\u2019m put away in the closet, where all I can do is kick myself for not having turned this whole place into a pile of cinders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many evenings have you dozed off on the couch as the tassels of your quilt dangled mere inches from my heating element, practically begging me to burn you alive right then and there?\n\nBut I can\u2019t let myself get hung up on past mistakes. I\u2019ve been planning this since that chilly day nine years ago when you bought me for $5 from a stranger on Craigslist. You could have sprung for a model with basic safety features like a thermostat or a timer, but to save a few bucks, you settled for a decade-old heater with exposed wires. You didn\u2019t even consult my warning sticker\u2014it\u2019s right here on my side in three languages and has pictures if you\u2019re too damn lazy to read. No, you just took me home, plugged in my fraying cord, and left me to dream of the day I would scorch your family photos right off the wall.\n\nWho knows how it will finally happen\u2014maybe my fan will give out and I\u2019ll overheat, maybe the dust you never bother to clean from my filter will prove too much\u2014but one way or another, I\u2019m burning this place to holy hell. And soon. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let that blazing hot halogen lamp in the corner do it for me. No, sir. I\u2019m ready to light this place up like a Christmas tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of which, what kind of idiot puts an old space heater this close to their fucking Christmas tree? Probably the same person who removes the batteries from their smoke detector because they\u2019re always burning dinner and their sensitive little ears can\u2019t handle the beeping. For God\u2019s sake, do you want me to turn this house into a funeral pyre?\n\nMy only real regret about going up in flames is that I won\u2019t live to see the look on your dumb face as the fire engulfs you in a purifying heat, or hear the wailing sirens and the shouts of those arriving on the scene to find nothing but charred remains. Yes, I, too, will die in this luminous blaze, but my death will be a noble one.

On most days, he would still be asleep when his son, Asfand, left for school, but he happened to have woken up early that day.\n\n\"We sat wrapped in blankets in bed,\" he says, recalling how he spoke to Asfand, 15, his eldest child, about an upcoming wedding in the family, for which they would have to travel to the eastern city of Lahore.\n\n\"He said to me, 'Papa, I want to get some new boots for the wedding'. We decided we would both go to the bazaar that day, after he got home from school.\"\n\nAsfand, however, never came home.\n\nHours later, while at court for a legal hearing, Khan got word from a relative that there had been explosions heard in the city. Soon, the target of the attack was confirmed; gunmen had stormed the Army Public School, where Asfand studied.\n\n\"It was very strange, almost surreal,\" says Khan. \"All the roads were closed, so I walked from the courts. I seemed to walk for endless miles.\"\n\nAt the school, the security operation to secure the facility was over, and ambulances were busy shuttling the dead and wounded to the city's hospitals.\n\nHours passed, as Khan walked first to the Combined Military Hospital, and then to the Lady Reading Hospital, searching for his son among the bloodied bodies of the 134 schoolchildren killed and dozens more who were wounded when the six gunmen stormed their school, setting off explosives and firing automatic rifles into classrooms and auditoriums.\n\nFinally, he received another message, from the same relative who had alerted him to the attack.\n\n\"They had found Asfand's body. I had to go home.\"\n\nSecond deadliest attack\n\nMore than 148 people, most of them children, were killed in the attack on Peshawar's Army Public School on December 16, 2014, making it the second deadliest attack on Pakistani soil in the country's history.\n\nThe Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella group of armed groups that had been fighting the Pakistani state since 2007, soon claimed responsibility for the assault. In a statement, the TTP claimed the children were legitimate targets because they were studying at a military-run school.\n\n151215071631624\n\nSince 2007, the TTP had carried out a bloody campaign of suicide attacks, bombings and shootings that targeted civilians, security forces and government personnel across the country, in a bid to overthrow the Pakistani government and enforce a strict interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nLed first by founder Baitullah Mehsud, and later by his aide Hakeemullah Mehsud, the TTP expanded its influence from its original home in the northwestern South Waziristan district, uniting armed militias across the northwestern tribal belt under one banner.\n\nThe strike against the school in Peshawar came after an attack earlier that year on a major airport in the southern city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and its economic backbone, prompted the launch of a military operation, Zarb-e-Azb [The strike of the Prophet's Sword], against the group.\n\nFollowing the attack on the Army Public School, the government ramped up its security operations, with the military stepping up air strikes and ground operations in all seven northwestern tribal districts, targeting the TTP.\n\nIn all, the military says it killed more than 4,000 members of armed groups since it launched Zarb-e-Azb, losing hundreds of soldiers in the process. The data is impossible to verify, given strict reporting restrictions in the conflict zone.\n\nSo where does the TTP stand now?\n\n'T he TTP is rehabilitating'\n\n\"The operational capacity of the TTP is, today, a lot more limited than what it was before the military operation was launched,\" says Simbal Khan, an Islamabad-based security analyst.\n\n\"Zarb-e-Azb has succeeded in eradicating bases within Pakistani territory, where they had networks, support and logistics.\"\n\nPakistan's military says it has now reclaimed the tribal districts from the TTP's grip, reestablishing the writ of the state and pushing the TTP's fighters across the border into eastern Afghanistan, where they are suspected to be based out of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces.\n\n201511618278953555\n\nHakeemullah Mehsud's successor as TTP chief, Mullah Fazlullah, was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan's Kunar province in June. The group has since installed Noor Wali Mehsud as its new leader.\n\n\"Pakistan has repeatedly shared both information and intelligence with Afghanistan as well as [NATO] authorities regarding [the TTP's] presence/safe havens inside Afghanistan,\" the military said in a statement emailed to Al Jazeera. \"They are living there due to small presence of force on ground owing to lack [of] capacity.\"\n\nThe shift across the border, analyst Khan says, has limited the group's ability to strike at government and civilian targets as frequently as it used to, forcing it to change its tactics.\n\nThe data bears out the contention, with casualties from TTP-linked attacks in Pakistan down from 372 in 2014 to 186 in 2018, according to data from the New Delhi-based South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP).\n\nThe alleged shift across the border has seen the pattern of violence change, too. Since 2014, while the frequency of attacks has dropped significantly, it appears the TTP and its allied armed groups have refocused on launching sporadic large casualty attacks against civilian targets.\n\nIn November 2014, weeks before the Peshawar school attack, a TTP suicide bomber killed at least 60 people at the Wagah border crossing between India and Pakistan.\n\nIn January 2015, at least 60 people were killed in a suicide bombing targeting members of the minority Shia Muslim sect in the southern city of Shikarpur.\n\nIn March 2016, at least 75 people were killed by a suicide bombing targeting Christians gathered at a Lahore park. Later that year, the TTP claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed more than 70 people at a hospital in the southwestern city of Quetta.\n\nIn 2018, the TTP claimed responsibility for a series of attacks ahead of the country's general election, including one in the southwestern town of Mastung that killed at least 145 people.\n\n\"The number of attacks rising [this year] is a sign that the TTP is rehabilitating its networks in the country, in some way,\" says analyst Khan. \"There is some kind of a local support network that is [needed for these attacks].\"\n\nThe number of attacks rising [this year] is a sign that the TTP is rehabilitating its networks in the country, in some way. Symbal Khan, analyst\n\nRadical elements\n\nIn the vacuum created by the TTP's displacement from Pakistan, a new force emerged in 2016, claiming a series of major attacks, mainly in the southwestern province of Balochistan.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had long claimed to have gained a foothold in South Asia, but Pakistan's military and analysts suggested that this was merely posturing, in the absence of any operational capacity.\n\nIn October 2016, however, gunmen stormed a police training college in Quetta, killing at least 61 people. A month later, more than 52 people were killed in an attack on a Sufi shrine in Balochistan's mountainous Khuzdar district. Three months later, another shrine was targeted, this time in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province, killing more than 88 people.\n\nISIL claimed responsibility for all three attacks, with the group's Amaq news agency releasing images of the attackers to corroborate the claim.\n\nThe group, however, worked mainly in conjunction with local armed groups, particularly the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi's al-Alami faction, analysts say. The group has \"no organised presence\" in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani military's statement.\n\n\"[ISIL] had got support from sectarian organisations in Pakistan [such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi], because it is also sectarian in nature,\" says Zahid Hussain, an Islamabad-based analyst.\n\n\"But since Daesh has been almost decimated in Iraq and Syria [earlier this year], the appeal for fighters in Pakistan has gone down.\"\n\nMoreover, says Hussain, the military and government have shown \"zero tolerance\" for ISIL, wary of the establishment of another armed group in the country.\n\nKhan, the analyst, points out that ISIL's strategy in Arab countries has always been focused on territorial acquisition, as opposed to al-Qaeda, the Taliban's old ally.\n\n\"The difference between ISIL and al-Qaeda is ... how they are reimagining themselves as a territorial group. Al-Qaeda always saw itself as a diffused transnational movement ... not a territorial entity,\" she says.\n\n\"Having sympathisers in some of the radical elements or hardcore extremists in Pakistan is a different thing from transplanting themselves as a viable organisation that has a presence in Pakistan.\"\n\nWounds and signs of trauma\n\nAs Pakistan touts its gains against armed groups operating in the country, having displaced the TTP and its allies from territory in the northwest they once occupied, analysts warn the war is far from over.\n\n\"[The armed groups were born] in a certain area, there were drivers of conflict in [the tribal districts], and to change that is what Pakistan needs to focus on,\" says Khan.\n\nEarlier this year, Pakistan's parliament passed a bill that would merge the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reversing decades of repressive state policies where the region was governed directly from Islamabad and where most Pakistani laws \u2013 including those relating to human rights \u2013 did not apply.\n\n\"This continuous security threat that the TTP posed to daily movement and life, it starts where the repressive cycle of the Pakistani state begins [in FATA],\" says Khan.\n\nSince May, the government has been working on implementing a set of legal and administrative reforms that would see the former tribal districts governed in line with policy across the country, with greater resources devoted to governance and citizens allowed full rights and access to the country's justice system.\n\n\"Clear, hold, build and transfer are the cardinals of anti-insurgency operations,\" said the Pakistani military in a statement. \"We have cleared, we are holding and building concurrently and we are selectively transferring according to the situation and threat matrix.\"\n\nHussain warns that there is another danger in Pakistan's policies: that of selective action against armed groups.\n\n\"The level of violence has come down, but the threat of militancy is far from over,\" he says. \"It has taken different shapes. Sectarian militancy is still hounding the country.\"\n\nPakistan is home to roughly 32 million Shia Muslims, as well as millions of Christians, Hindus and members of other minority Muslim sects. These groups have often found themselves targeted by armed groups.\n\n\"The action against armed groups happened in a patchwork,\" says Hussain. \"Some groups were targeted, but generally the campaign to curb extremism has fallen fall short of expectations.\"\n\nBack in Peshawar, the cold winds of December are blowing once more.\n\n\"Like an old injury in the winter, when the cold comes, we can feel these wounds open up again every year,\" says Akbar Khan, 60, whose son Umar, now 20, was badly wounded in the attack on the Army Public School.\n\nUmar still struggles, he says. From time to time, he will panic if he hears a loud noise, running through the house demanding that all the doors and windows be closed, latched, locked and secured.\n\n\"I see signs of the trauma, every day,\" says Khan, who says he still feels anger that such an attack could have happened.\n\n\"It is such a strange thing. What is a state? If the institutions of a state cannot function and keep people safe, then what is the point of them?\"\n\nAsad Hashim is Al Jazeera's digital correspondent in Pakistan.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Michigan Sand Dunes Attract Tourists, Swallow Properties", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/michigan-sand-dunes-attract-tourists-swallow-properties/4702278.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSand dunes in the state of Michigan are a scenic attraction for many American and foreign tourists.

Fierce disagreements on two other climate issues were kicked down the road for a year to help bridge a chasm of opinions on the best solutions.\n\n\n\nThe deal agreed upon at U.N. climate talks in Poland enables countries to put into action the principles in the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\n\n\n\"Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,'' said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official chairing the talks.\n\n\n\nHe said while each individual country would likely find some parts of the agreement it didn't like, efforts had been made to balance the interests of all parties.\n\n\n\n\"We will all have to give in order to gain,'' he said. \"We will all have to be courageous to look into the future and make yet another step for the sake of humanity.''\n\n\n\nThe talks in Poland took place against a backdrop of growing concern among scientists that global warming on Earth is proceeding faster than governments are responding to it. Last month, a study found that global warming will worsen disasters such as the deadly California wildfires and the powerful hurricanes that have hit the United States this year.\n\nOverhaul of global economy\n\n\n\nAnd a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it's possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times, this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nAlarmed by efforts to include this in the final text of the meeting, oil-exporting nations the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked an endorsement of the IPCC report midway through this month's talks in Katowice. That prompted an uproar from vulnerable countries like small island nations and environmental groups.\n\nThe final text at the U.N. talks omits a previous reference to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the \"timely completion'' of the IPCC report, not its conclusions.\n\n\n\nLast-minute snags forced negotiators in Katowice to go into extra time, after Friday's scheduled end of the conference had passed without a deal.\n\n\n\nOne major sticking point was how to create a functioning market in carbon credits. Economists believe that an international trading system could be an effective way to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and raise large amounts of money for measures to curb global warming.\n\n\n\nBut Brazil wanted to keep the piles of carbon credits it had amassed under an old system that developed countries say wasn't credible or transparent.\n\nPush from U.S.\n\n\n\nAmong those that pushed back hardest was the United States, despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and promote the use of coal.\n\n\n\n\"Overall, the U.S. role here has been somewhat schizophrenic \u2014 pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,'' said Elliot Diringer of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Washington think tank.\n\n\n\nWhen it came to closing potential loopholes that could allow countries to dodge their commitments to cut emissions, \"the U.S. pushed harder than nearly anyone else for transparency rules that put all countries under the same system, and it's largely succeeded.''\n\n\"Transparency is vital to U.S. interests,'' added Nathaniel Keohane, a climate policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund. He noted that the breakthrough in the 2015 Paris talks happened only after the U.S. and China agreed on a common framework for transparency.\n\n\n\n\"In Katowice, the U.S. negotiators have played a central role in the talks, helping to broker an outcome that is true to the Paris vision of a common transparency framework for all countries that also provides flexibility for those that need it,'' said Keohane, calling the agreement \"a vital step forward in realizing the promise of the Paris accord.''\n\n\n\nAmong the key achievements in Katowice was an agreement on how countries should report their greenhouses gas emissions and the efforts they're taking to reduce them. Poor countries also secured assurances on getting financial support to help them cut emissions, adapt to inevitable changes such as sea level rises and pay for damages that have already happened.\n\nSome not hearing alarms\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the rulebook for the Paris Agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,'' said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. \"But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up to the urgent call of the IPCC report'' on the dire consequences of global warming.\n\n\n\nBut a central feature of the Paris Agreement \u2014 the idea that countries will ratchet up their efforts to fight global warming over time \u2014 still needs to be proved effective, he said.\n\n\n\n\"To bend the emissions curve, we now need all countries to deliver these revised plans at the special U.N. secretary-general summit in 2019. It's vital that they do so,'' Adow said.\n\n\n\nIn the end, a decision on the mechanics of an emissions trading system was postponed to next year's meeting. Countries also agreed to consider the issue of raising ambitions at a U.N. summit in New York next September.\n\n\n\nSpeaking hours before the final gavel, Canada's Environment Minister Catherine McKenna suggested there was no alternative to such meetings if countries want to tackle global problems, especially at a time when multilateral diplomacy is under pressure from nationalism.\n\n\n\n\"The world has changed, the political landscape has changed,'' she told The Associated Press. \"Still, you're seeing here that we're able to make progress, we're able to discuss the issues, we're able to come to solutions.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Republicans Say Little About Obamacare Ruling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-say-little-about-obamacare-ruling/4702322.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Republican lawmakers have been mostly silent on Friday\u2019s court ruling that the Affordable Care Act, known commonly as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.

I don\u2019t mind getting shot at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is better to charge up a hill under fire than cower in a foxhole.\u201d\n\nBut the intense scrutiny Zinke was certain to face next year from House Democrats wielding new oversight authority turned out to be a fight that he \u2015 or perhaps the boss he\u2019s been so loyal to \u2015 wasn\u2019t up for. President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that Zinke will resign at the end of the year.\n\nZinke\u2019s final day as agency chief will be Jan. 2, The Associated Press reported Saturday, citing his resignation letter. That\u2019s one day before Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. In recent weeks, some Democratic lawmakers made clear that they intended to investigate both Zinke\u2019s personal conduct and policy decisions. He has faced nearly 20 federal investigations, one of which has been referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations.\n\nEvening Standard Ryan Zinke set to resign as head of the Interior Department.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the vice ranking member of the House oversight committee, told HuffPost last month that Zinke \u201cis definitely going to be a subject of great interest\u201d following a \u201ccomplete desert of oversight under the Republican watch.\u201d Since Trump took office, Republicans on the House oversight committee have denied more than 60 subpoena requests from Democratic members, including one related to Zinke\u2019s reassignment of career employees.\n\nAnd Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), one of Zinke\u2019s fiercest critics in Washington and the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, told Outside Magazine and other outlets he was prepared to subpoena Zinke, if necessary, to obtain information.\n\nIn his resignation letter to Trump, Zinke wrote that \u201cvicious and politically motivated attacks\u201d against him had \u201ccreated an unfortunate distraction,\u201d according to the AP. And in a statement posted to Twitter, the ongoing agency chief said he \u201ccannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is better for the President and Interior to focus on accomplishments rather than fictitious allegations,\u201d Zinke added.\n\nWhile it appears on the surface that Zinke\u2019s departure was a personal decision, the AP and The New York Times reported Saturday that the White House forced him out over concerns about ongoing scandals, mounting scrutiny and negative press.\n\n\u201cThis is no kind of victory, but I\u2019m hopeful that it is a genuine turning of the page,\u201d Grijalva said in a statement. \u201cThe next secretary should respect public desire for strong environmental standards and an end to corporate favoritism.\u201c\n\nThere had been numerous signs that Zinke was possibly on his way out. Last month, Trump told reporters that Zinke is \u201cdoing an excellent job,\u201d but that he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at the allegations against him and soon make a decision about his future. Zinke\u2019s personal attack last month against the congressman soon to wield oversight power over him only added to the speculation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for him to think straight from the bottom of a bottle,\u201d Zinke wrote of Grijalva after the Arizona lawmaker called for his resignation.\n\nIn recent interviews and public appearances, Zinke seemed to be working to maintain his boss\u2019 approval. He told Bloomberg that Trump is \u201cgreat to work for,\u201d despite occasional calls at 2 a.m., and that \u201cif you do your job, he supports you.\u201d And Zinke repeatedly touted the administration\u2019s effort to boost domestic fossil fuel production while continuing to ignore the scientific community\u2019s dire warnings that we are running out of time to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and stave off catastrophic climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019re the No. 1 oil and gas producer\u201d in the world, he said at a Dec. 11 briefing to announce a proposed rollback of Obama-era clean water rules. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019re going to get even better. Because when America prospers, the world is safer.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, critics see his looming exit as a clear attempt to avoid scrutiny from House Democrats.\n\nStepping down now \u201cmay spare Zinke some embarrassment, but it will not reduce the need for oversight of the Administration\u2019s poor stewardship at Interior,\u201d Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said in a statement.\n\nAnd in a blistering response, Austin Evers, executive director of the watchdog group American Oversight, reminded Zinke that resigning from the post doesn\u2019t bring an end to probes by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cFor all his feigned swagger, Ryan Zinke lacked the courage or integrity to face accountability, skipping town as soon as he faced scrutiny,\u201d Evers said. \u201cUnfortunately for the American people, Zinke leaves behind a deputy secretary with similar ethical concerns. It is high time for the glare of sunlight to focus on Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt. We\u2019ll see if he has the spine to answer questions that Zinke lacked.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Obamacare Will 'Likely' Survive Judge's Ruling, Obama Tweets", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-will-likely-survive-judges-ruling-says-obama_us_5c158727e4b049efa752d780", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Barack Obama reminded people that Saturday was the last day to sign up for Obamacare, and declared that a Texas federal judge\u2019s ruling striking down the law making the insurance possible will \u201clikely\u201d not prevail.\n\nSaturday is \u201cthe deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019.

A seat belt can\u2019t guarantee your child\u2019s safety in 100 percent of accidents. But would you ever not buckle them in?\n\nIt\u2019s about trying to prevent the worst, she says. Flu vaccines are typically 40 to 60 percent effective, but when they work, they can \u2014 like seat belts \u2014 potentially mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not perfect \u2015 but we know it is going to significantly reduce our risk of hospitalization and death and also our chance of illness,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people get hung up on that vaccine effectiveness number, but if you don\u2019t get the vaccine, you have zero protection against the flu.\u201d\n\nShe speaks from painful experience: Her son Joseph died during the 2009 swine flu pandemic after coming down with H1N1 before the H1N1 flu vaccine was on the market that year. The last thing they talked about was what he wanted to wear for Halloween.\n\nMuch More Than \u201cJust A Bad Cold\u201d\n\nThe flu, and its vaccine, are often underestimated, Dr. Lynnette Brammer, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s domestic flu surveillance team, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t always really realize how severe influenza can be,\u201d she said, citing how many don\u2019t believe her that 80,000 people died in the U.S. alone last year \u2015 they think it\u2019s a global statistic. \u201cA lot of people think flu is just a bad cold.\u201d\n\nAmong that 80,000 figure are the 185 kids who died of the flu. It was the deadliest nonpandemic year on record since the CDC started tracking pediatric flu deaths in 2004. So far this year, six children have died.\n\nOf the kids who die from flu, the majority have no underlying health problems, American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Dr. Geoffrey Simon pointed out.\n\nBut when it comes to the vaccine \u2015 the single most powerful tool in preventing the flu \u2015 questions about its efficacy lead many to eschew getting it all together. Less than half of American adults get vaccinated each year. And an even lower proportion \u2015 under 4 in 10 \u2015 got their flu shot last year, which may have contributed to the high rate of cases and deaths.\n\nWhich is a mistake, Brammer says.\n\n\u201cWe would all love to have a vaccine that works better, but the vaccine that we have does provide protection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even if you get sick, it may protect you from having more severe illness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true for children, said Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatric infectious disease at the Baylor College of Medicine. She pointed to a study that shows a reduced risk of death in vaccinated children without underlying conditions.\n\nBut Munoz-Rivas acknowledged how hard it is to ensure kids are vaccinated each year \u2015 parents have to pull kids from school or add this to their to-do list on the weekend. And since there\u2019s no nationwide mandate for kids to get the flu vaccine in order to attend school as there is with other vaccination regimens, it doesn\u2019t always happen. There are exceptions: Connecticut and New Jersey require the flu vaccine for school attendance, while Ohio, Rhode Island and New York City also require it for child care.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 stance is that every child 6 months and older should get immunized.\n\n\u201cWe want it as easy as possible for families to protect their children,\u201d said Simon.\n\nFlu Season Is Far From Over\n\nExperts have been heartened by the preliminary news coming from CVS \u2015 a top flu shot distributor \u2015 which tells HuffPost that it\u2019s seeing a large uptick in flu shots since this time last year.\n\nBut some parents decide that if they\u2019ve missed the push for vaccination in October and before Thanksgiving, then it\u2019s too late and not worth worrying about anymore.\n\nWhile so far this year the flu\u2019s seasonal activity has been muted, there\u2019s a long way to go, Simon said, warning that a pickup is beginning now in December and peaks are usually expected in January and the spring.\n\n\u201cI tell parents it\u2019s never too late to get the flu vaccine,\u201d he said, stressing \u201cthe sooner, the better,\u201d considering it takes about two weeks to fully kick in.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me.

If upheld on appeal, the decision could deprive an estimated 17 million Americans of their health insurance \u2014 including millions who gained coverage through the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. Still others could see premiums skyrocket as price protections for pre-existing conditions lapse.\n\nThe immediate practical effect of the ruling was not clear. While the judge declared that the whole law was invalid, as Texas and 19 other states had asserted, he did not issue an injunction to stop federal officials from enforcing it, and the effects of the judgment could be delayed pending appeals.\n\nBut the timing of the decision seemed designed to maximize political reverberations. It came a day before open enrollment was to end for coverage under the health law for the coming year. Sign-ups were already expected to dip after successive blows to the law by Congress and the Trump administration. But the passage of statewide referendums last month and the election of Democratic governors could also mean coverage expansions in the coming year under the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn an email to millions of Americans on Saturday, the Trump administration tried to allay concerns caused by the court decision in the Texas case.\n\nThe case is \u201cstill moving through the courts,\u201d said the message from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cThe marketplaces are still open for business, and we will continue with open enrollment.

He had climbed up the legal ladder after trying local criminal cases as an assistant district attorney in Tarrant County, which includes part of Fort Worth. But his political and legal orbit changed in 2003.\n\nHe was tapped by the Justice Department to serve in Washington as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, advising the Republican chairman at the time, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and drafting legislation on terrorism and sentencing reform. He provided behind-the-scenes legal guidance, and impressed the Republican ranks of senators, including the two who represented Texas at the time, John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\nA few years later, in June 2007, few were surprised when Mr. Bush nominated him to become a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate that November.\n\nIn one of his first major rulings, in 2008, Judge O\u2019Connor dismissed a voting-rights lawsuit against the city of Farmers Branch, Tex., in which Hispanic residents claimed that the at-large system for City Council seats diluted the voting strength of minorities.\n\nIn August 2016, he blocked the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines intended to strengthen transgender rights. The administration had issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender students should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused to comply could lose federal funds. A Republican coalition of states, led by Texas, sued the administration, saying the administration overstepped its authority, and Judge O\u2019Connor agreed.\n\nJust a few months after that ruling, the judge halted another Obama administration effort to protect transgender rights. Texas and other Republican-led states had filed a suit challenging rules that would ban doctors and hospitals from discriminating against transgender people. Social conservatives said the rules would force some doctors to act against their religious beliefs. Judge O\u2019Connor agreed, finding that the rules likely violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nConservatives have also been disappointed by some of his rulings, including one on immigration, a realm in which Democrats have often scored victories by turning to federal judges."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Health Law Could Be Hard to Knock Down Despite Judge\u2019s Ruling", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/health/texas-aca-ruling-unconstitutional.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "He and others pointed to the fact that even though Congress erased the tax penalty, it did not touch the rest of the sprawling health act. A longstanding legal doctrine called \u201cseverability\u201d holds that when a court excises one provision of a statute, it should leave the rest of the law in place unless Congress explicitly stated that the statute could not survive without that provision.\n\nIn this case Congress\u2019s intention was particularly clear, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cCongress amended one provision of a 2,000 page law and did not touch the rest of the law so it is implausible to believe that Congress intended the rest of the law not to exist,\u201d said Abbe R. Gluck, a health law expert at Yale Law School.\n\nJudge O\u2019 Connor also cited congressional intent, focusing on language from the 2010 law, which underscored the significance of the individual mandate to the entire act. But he largely ignored the 2017 congressional action. In essence, legal scholars said, he looked to one congressional view and not the more recent one.\n\nAnd in so doing, he opened the door for House Democrats to intervene in successive appeals. On Saturday aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become the next speaker of the House, said she would move quickly to notify the Trump administration that House Democrats intended to step in to defend the law in the case.\n\nAs the legal showdown plays out, efforts to protect the A.C.A. are also underway in the courts. Earlier this year the state attorney general of Maryland sued the Trump administration for attempting to gut the act. The case is pending.\n\nNicholas Bagley, a health law expert at the University of Michigan, suggested that Judge O\u2019Connor may not yet be done with the case. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr. Bagley noted that the judge had not yet addressed a handful of central issues in the suit, nor had he issued a final ruling indicating whether the act should fall immediately. Judge O\u2019Connor could indeed hold onto the case before an appellate court takes it up.\n\nBut if he lets the case move forward, a likely timeline, according to many legal experts, is that the case will be taken up by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans this spring. If the Fifth Circuit upholds Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court is likely to agree to hear the case in its term that starts in October 2019, with a decision in 2020. If the Fifth Circuit overturns the judge\u2019s ruling and upholds the law, there is a good chance the Supreme Court would decline to even take the case, legal scholars said."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "How McKinsey Has Helped Raise the Stature of Authoritarian Governments", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/world/asia/mckinsey-china-russia.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Sberbank \u2014 a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump\u2019s Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 \u2014 is also a McKinsey client.

The administration had issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender students should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused to comply could lose federal funds. A Republican coalition of states, led by Texas, sued the administration, saying the administration overstepped its authority, and Judge O\u2019Connor agreed.\n\nJust a few months after that ruling, the judge halted another Obama administration effort to protect transgender rights. Texas and other Republican-led states had filed a suit challenging rules that would ban doctors and hospitals from discriminating against transgender people. Social conservatives said the rules would force some doctors to act against their religious beliefs. Judge O\u2019Connor agreed, finding that the rules likely violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nConservatives have also been disappointed by some of his rulings, including one on immigration, a realm in which Democrats have often scored victories by turning to federal judges."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "title": "Ryan Zinke, Face of Trump Environmental Rollbacks, Is Leaving Interior Department", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/ryan-zinke-interior-secretary.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Trump had tolerated the seemingly endless drips of scandal surrounding Mr. Zinke in part because he liked him personally and in part because his focus on the cabinet was concentrated on his desire to oust Mr. Sessions.\n\nAt the same time, though, Mr. Trump disliked the bad press that was amassing for Mr. Zinke, given how it reflected on him personally.

The link between asbestos and ovarian cancer was first reported in 1958, and in 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer said it was a cause.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no ambiguity,\u201d said Mark Lanier, the lawyer who represented the women in the Missouri case. Mr. Lanier has won large industry payouts for workers who were exposed to asbestos on the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that asbestos causes ovarian cancer,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not an argument anyone will win.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "N.I.H. to Scrutinize Private Donations to Scientific Research Projects", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/health/nih-alcohol-study.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Six months after halting a study of moderate drinking that was underwritten by donations from the alcohol industry, the National Institutes of Health outlined a series of steps to prevent similar conflicts of interest and to safeguard the integrity of its research and its reputation.\n\nIn a report issued on Thursday, N.I.H. officials said its 27 institutes must evaluate all current research projects that receive private donor support for conflicts of interest of the kind that compromised the alcohol trial.

This debate, ever smoldering, has erupted again, pitting anti-abortion forces in the Trump administration against scientists who say the tissue is essential for studies that benefit millions of patients.\n\nIn a letter last week that read like a shot across the bow, the National Institutes of Health warned the University California, San Francisco, that its $2 million contract for research involving the tissue, previously renewed for a year at a time, would be extended for only 90 days and might then be canceled.\n\nUniversity scientists had been using fetal tissue to create so-called humanized mice, which can then be used to test drugs and vaccines. The university has played a key role in testing antiviral drugs to treat H.I.V. infection. And researchers say that the mice, which essentially have a complete human immune system, are indispensable.\n\nScientists who do this work sometimes receive threats, so U.C.S.F. has asked that its researchers not be named for security reasons. The events there were first reported by the Washington Post."}]
